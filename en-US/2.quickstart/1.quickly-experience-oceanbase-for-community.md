## Background

OceanBase Database provides an all-in-one installation package since V4.0.0. You can use this package to install OceanBase Deployer (OBD), OceanBase Database, OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), OceanBase Agent (OBAgent), Grafana, and Prometheus at a time. Since V4.1.0, you can also use the all-in-one package to install OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express. You can choose to install some or all of the components as needed.

## Deployment solutions

Three deployment solutions are provided for you to quickly get started with OceanBase Database. You can choose a solution based on the actual situation.

* Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment

   If you have only one server, you can quickly build a demo environment to deploy OceanBase Database. The demo database provides basic features for you to quickly learn about OceanBase Database, but does not support distributed capabilities or high availability. Therefore, long-term use is not recommended. For more information, see the **Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment** section blow.

* Solution 2: Deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster

   You can choose this solution if you want to learn more about the distributed architecture and features of OceanBase Database. The cluster provides distributed capabilities and high availability apart from complete database features. To use this solution, you must have three hosts, each of which has four CPU cores, 10 GB of memory, and 50 GB of disk space. For more information, see the **Solution 2: Deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster** section below.

* Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container (applicable only to the community edition)

   If you are using a non-Linux OS, such as Windows or macOS, and want to deploy and manage OceanBase Database in a container, you can choose this solution. This solution has not been verified by large-scale practices and therefore is not recommended. For more information, see the **Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container** section below.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p> The following describes the deployment of OceanBase Database on an x86-based CentOS Linux 7.9 platform. The procedure may be different on other OS platforms.  </p>
</main>

## Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment

If you have only one server available, you can run the `obd demo` command to quickly deploy a standalone OceanBase database by following the procedure described in this section.

### Step 1: Download and install the all-in-one package

1. Download the all-in-one package and upload it to any directory on your server.

   * For OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition, contact the Technical Support to obtain the all-in-one package.

   * For OceanBase Database Community Edition, download the latest all-in-one package from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).

2. In the directory where the package is located, run the following commands to decompress and install the package:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ tar -xzf oceanbase-all-in-one-*.tar.gz
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./install.sh
   [admin@test001 bin]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy the OceanBase database on a single server

1. Run either of the following commands for quick deployment.

   * Enterprise edition

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obd demo -c oceanbase,obproxy,obagent,prometheus,grafana
      ```

   * Community edition

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obd demo
      ```

   By default, the `obd demo` command deploys the OceanBase database and its components (which are ODP, OBAgent, Grafana, and Prometheus) with minimum specifications and then starts them in the home directory of the current user. The name of the deployed cluster is fixed to `demo` in OBD. For more information about custom deployment, see [Quick deployment command](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000860052).

   You can use OBD commands to manage the OceanBase database. For more information about the commands, see [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000862273).

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>If you install Grafana or Prometheus, its access address is returned in the command output. On Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the command may fail to obtain a public IP address but return a private IP address. You must use a correct public IP address. </p>
   </main>

2. Connect to the OceanBase database from OBClient.

   * Directly connect to the database through port 2881

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2881 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A
      ```

   * Connect to the database in proxy mode through ODP

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2883 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A --proxy-mode
      ```

## Solution 2: Deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster

If you have multiple servers available, you can run the `obd web` command to start the GUI of OBD and deploy a distributed OceanBase cluster on the GUI.

<!-- <main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p> This section describes only simple operations needed to quickly deploy a distributed OceanBase cluster. For more information, see <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-cn-10000000001690695">Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI</a> in OBD Documentation. </p>

   ```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>The default port in the URL is 8680. You can use the <code>obd web -p &lt;PORT></code> command to specify a port. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>On Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the command may fail to obtain a public IP address but return a private IP address. You must use a correct public IP address to access the GUI. </p>

      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h10.10.10.1 -P2883 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A --proxy-mode
      ```

## Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container

You can deploy OceanBase Database in a Docker container to quickly get started with OceanBase Database.

### (Optional) Step 1: Pull the image of OceanBase Database

Run the following commands to pull the image needed by OceanBase Database.

* Search for images related to OceanBase Database

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ docker search oceanbase
   ```

* Pull the latest image of OceanBase Database

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ docker pull oceanbase/oceanbase-ce
   ```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p> By default, the preceding command pulls the latest version of Docker image. You can select a desired image from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/oceanbase/oceanbase-ce/tags">Docker images</a> as needed. </p>
</main>

### Step 2: Start an OceanBase Database instance

Run either of the following commands to start an OceanBase Database instance.

* Deploy an instance with the maximum specifications supported by the container

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ docker run -p 2881:2881 --name obstandalone -e MINI_MODE=0 -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce
   ```

* Deploy a mini standalone instance

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ docker run -p 2881:2881 --name obstandalone -e MINI_MODE=1 -d oceanbase/oceanbase-ce
   ```

It takes 2 to 5 minutes to start an instance. Run the following command. If `boot success!` is returned, the instance is started.

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ docker logs obstandalone | tail -1
boot success!
```

### Step 3: Connect to the OceanBase Database instance

The oceanbase-ce image is integrated with OBClient and the default connection script `ob-mysql`.

```shell
$ Log on to the sys tenant of the cluster as the root user
[admin@test001 ~]$ docker exec -it obstandalone ob-mysql sys

$ Log on to the test tenant of the cluster as the root user
[admin@test001 ~]$ docker exec -it obstandalone ob-mysql root

$ Log on to the test tenant of the cluster as the test user
[admin@test001 ~]$ docker exec -it obstandalone ob-mysql test
```

You can also run the following command to connect to the instance by using the OBClient or MySQL client on your local server:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -uroot@sys -h127.1 -P2881
```

After the connection is established, the following information is displayed:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ docker exec -it obstandalone ob-mysql sys

login as root@sys
Command is: obclient -h127.1 -uroot@sys -A -Doceanbase -P2881
