# Version number guidelines

This topic introduces the version number guidelines and their meanings for OceanBase Database.

As OceanBase Database continues to evolve and improve, new versions are released periodically. These versions can differ greatly in terms of features and capabilities, so it's essential to identify your database version to obtain the correct documentation.

OceanBase Database versions are represented as V.x.y.z.f, where:

* x indicates a major version, typically involving architecture upgrades or significant new features.

* y indicates a planned iteration version, featuring important updates and enhancements as part of the regular update cycle.

* z indicates an updated version, containing minor feature updates and fixes for known issues.

* f indicates a patch upgrade version, used to identify updates in features and fixes when a higher version number is needed
