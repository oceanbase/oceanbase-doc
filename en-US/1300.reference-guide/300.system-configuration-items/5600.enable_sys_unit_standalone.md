Note the following impacts when you set this configuration item to `True`:

* When you create or add resource pools, you cannot deploy units of a common tenant and units of the system tenant on the same server.

  

* The system will migrate the units of other tenants from the server on which the units of the system tenant are deployed.

  

* When a server is permanently taken offline or deleted, the system will migrate units of the system tenant first to one server and then migrate the units of other tenants to a different server.

  

* During balancing for tenant groups, the system filters out the server where the units of the system tenant are deployed from servers that are available to tenant groups. That is, units of tenants in the tenant groups will be distributed among all servers, except the server where the units of the system tenant are located.
