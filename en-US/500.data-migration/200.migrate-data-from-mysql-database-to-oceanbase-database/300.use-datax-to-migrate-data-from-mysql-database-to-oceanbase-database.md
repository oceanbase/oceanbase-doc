# Use DataX to migrate table data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database

DataX is an open-source version of Alibaba Cloud DataWorks. It is an offline data synchronization tool widely used by Alibaba Group. It efficiently synchronizes data between heterogeneous data sources such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hive, ADS, HBase, Table Store (OTS), MaxCompute (formerly known as ODPS), Distributed Relational Database Service (DRDS), and OceanBase Database. 

If you use OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition, you can request the internal version of DataX (RPM package) from Technical Support of OceanBase Database. If you use OceanBase Database Community Edition, you can download the source code from the [open source website of DataX](https://github.com/alibaba/datax) and then compile the code. During compilation, remove unused database plug-ins from the `pom.xml` file. Otherwise, the compiled package will be very large. 

## Framework design

![DataX](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/1080760461/p338283.png)

DataX is an offline data synchronization framework that is designed based on the framework + plug-in architecture. Data source reads and writes are abstracted as the reader and writer plug-ins and are integrated into the entire framework. 

* The reader plug-in is a data collection module that collects data from a data source and sends the data to the framework. 

* The writer plug-in is a data write module that retrieves data from the framework and writes the data to the destination. 

* The framework builds a data transmission channel to connect the reader and the writer and processes core technical issues such as caching, throttling, concurrency control, and data conversion. 

DataX migrates data through tasks. Each task migrates only one table and has a configuration file in `JSON` format. The configuration file contains two sections: `reader` and `writer`. `reader` and `writer` respectively correspond to the database read and write plug-ins supported by DataX. For example, when you migrate table data from a MySQL database to an OceanBase database, the `mysqlreader` plug-in of MySQL and the `oceanbasev10writer` plug-in of OceanBase Database are used to respectively read data from the MySQL database and write the data to the OceanBase database. The following sections describe the `mysqlreader` and `oceanbasev10writer` plug-ins. 

### `mysqlreader` plug-in

The `mysqlreader` plug-in reads data from a MySQL database. mysqlreader connects to a remote MySQL database through JDBC and executes the corresponding SQL statements to select data from the MySQL database. 

mysqlreader connects to a remote MySQL database through JDBC, generates a query statement based on the configured information, and sends the statement to the remote MySQL database. The remote MySQL database assembles the execution result of the SQL statement into an abstract dataset by using the custom data types of DataX and passes the dataset to the downstream writer for processing. 

For more information about the features and parameters, see [`mysqlreader` plug-in](https://github.com/alibaba/DataX/blob/master/mysqlreader/doc/mysqlreader.md). 

### `oceanbasev10writer` plug-in

The `oceanbasev10writer` plug-in writes data to the destination table in the OceanBase database.
oceanbasev10writer connects to a remote OceanBase database from a Java client (MySQL JDBC or OBClient) by using ODP and executes the corresponding SQL INSERT statement to write the data to the remote OceanBase database. The data is committed to the remote OceanBase database in batches. 

Oceanbasev10Writer uses the DataX framework to obtain the protocol data generated by the reader and then generates an insert statement. If a primary key or unique key conflict occurs when data is written, you can update all fields in the table by using the `replace` mode for a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, and only the insert mode for an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database. For performance purposes, the batch write mode is used. A write request is initiated only when the number of rows reaches the specified threshold. 

### DataX configuration file

Example:

```json
{
  "job": {
    "content": [
      {
        "reader": {
          "name": "streamreader",
          "parameter": {
            "sliceRecordCount": 10,
            "column": [
              {
                "type": "long",
                "value": "10"
              },
              {
                "type": "string",
                "value": "hello, world-DataX"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "writer": {
          "name": "streamwriter",
          "parameter": {
            "encoding": "UTF-8",
            "print": true
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "setting": {
      "speed": {
        "channel": 2
       }
    }
  }
}
```
> Notice
>
> DataX migrates only the data of a table. Therefore, you must create the schema of the table in the destination database in advance. 

Place the `JSON` configuration file in the `job` directory of DataX or in a custom path. Run the following command:

```bash
$bin/datax.py job/stream2stream.json
```

Output:

```bash
<.....>

```

After DataX executes a task, it generates a simple task report that covers the preceding average traffic, write speed, and total number of read/write failures. 

You can specify the speed and error record limit in the job parameter `settings` of DataX.

```json
"setting": {
            "speed": {
                "channel": 10
            },
            "errorLimit": {
                "record": 10,
                "percentage": 0.1
            }
        }
```

Parameters:

- `errorLimit`: the limit on the number of error records. When this limit is exceeded, the task is terminated. 
- `channel`: the concurrency. Technically, a higher concurrency value indicates higher migration performance. In actual operations, you must also consider the read pressure on the source database, network transmission performance, and write performance of the destination database. 

## Prepare the environment

Download the .tar package from http://datax-opensource.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/datax.tar.gz.

## Use DataX to migrate data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database

When you migrate data from a MySQL database to an OceanBase database, if the source and destination databases cannot concurrently connect to the DataX server, you can export the data as CSV files and then import the CSV files to the destination database. If the source and destination databases can concurrently connect to the DataX server, you can use DataX to directly migrate data from the source to the destination. 

Example: Migrate the data of the tpccdb.bmsql_order table in a MySQL database to the tpcc.bmsql_order table in a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database.

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|--------------------|
| name | The name of the reader or writer database plug-in for connecting to the database. The reader plug-in of MySQL is mysqlreader, and the writer plug-in of OceanBase Database is oceanbasev10writer. For more information about the reader and writer plug-ins, see [DataX data source guide](https://github.com/alibaba/datax).  |
| jdbcUrl | The JDBC URL of the database to which you want to connect. The value is a JSON array and multiple URLs can be entered for a database. You need to enter at least one JDBC URL in the JSON array. The value must be entered in compliance with the MySQL official format. You can also specify a configuration property in the URL. For more information, see [Configuration Properties](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html) in the MySQL documentation.  </br> **Notice**</br><li>The JDBC URL must be included in the connection section of the code.</br> </li> <li>You must connect to OceanBase Database by using ODP. The default port is 2883. </li><li> The JDBC URL of the writer does not need to be enclosed with square brackets (`[]`) but the JDBC URL of the reader must be enclosed with square brackets (`[]`).</li></li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| username | The username for logging on to the database.</li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| password | The password of the specified username required to log on to the database.</li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| table | The table to be synchronized. The value is a JSON array and multiple tables can be specified at the same time. When you specify multiple tables, make sure that they use the same schema structure. The MySQL Reader does not verify whether the specified tables belong to the same logic table. </br>**Notice**</br>The table string must be included in the connection section of the code. </li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| column | The set of names of columns to be synchronized in the configured table. The values are specified in a JSON array. We recommend that you do not set the column parameter to `['*']`, because this configuration changes when the schema changes. We recommend that you specify specific column names.  Column pruning is supported. You can export only the specified columns. Column reordering is supported. You can export columns without following the column order in the table schema. You can specify constants in the MySQL SQL format: ``["id", "`table`", "1", "'bazhen.csy'", "null", "to_char(a + 1)", "2.3" , "true"]``.  </br>**Note** <ul><li>`id` is a regular column name. </li> <li>`table` is the name of the column that includes a reserved word.</li> <li>`1` is an integer constant. </li>  <li>`bazhen.csy` is a string constant. </li> <li>`null` is a null pointer. </li> <li>`to_char(a + 1)` is an expression. </li> <li>`2.3` is a floating point number. </li><li>`true` is a Boolean value. </li></ul></li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| where | The filter condition. The MySQL reader assembles the specified column, table, and WHERE clause into an SQL statement. Then, the MySQL reader extracts data based on this SQL statement. To synchronize data of the current day, you can specify the WHERE clause as`gmt_create > $bizdate`.<br>  **Notice**</br>You cannot set the WHERE clause to `limit 10`, because `limit` is not a valid WHERE clause of an SQL statement.  A WHERE clause allows you to orderly synchronize the incremental business data. If you do not specify the WHERE clause or do not specify the key or value of the WHERE clause, DataX performs full synchronization. </li><li>Required: No.</li><li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |

After the job configuration file is configured, execute this job.

```shell
python datax.py ../job/myjob.json
