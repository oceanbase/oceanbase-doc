# Use DataX to migrate CSV files to OceanBase Database

DataX is the open-source version of Alibaba Cloud DataWorks. It is an offline data synchronization tool widely used in Alibaba Group. DataX efficiently synchronizes data between heterogeneous data sources such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), Hive, ADS, HBase, Tablestore (OTS), MaxCompute (formerly known as ODPS), Distributed Relational Database Service (DRDS), and OceanBase Database.

You can download the source code from the [DataX open-source website](https://github.com/alibaba/datax) and compile the code. During compilation, you can delete database plug-ins that you do not need from the `pom.xml` file to control the size of the compiled package.

## Framework design

![DataX](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/1080760461/p338283.png)

DataX is an offline data synchronization framework that is designed based on the framework + plug-in architecture. It abstracts the data source reads and writes into the reader/writer plugins, which are incorporated into the entire synchronization framework.

* The reader plug-in is a data collection module that collects data from a data source and sends the data to the framework.

* The writer plug-in is a data write module that retrieves data from the framework and writes the data to the destination.

* The framework builds a data transmission channel to connect the reader and the writer and processes core technical issues such as caching, throttling, concurrency, and data conversion.

DataX migrates data through tasks. Each task processes only one table and has a configuration file in the `JSON` format. The configuration file contains two parts: `reader` and `writer`. The `reader` and `writer` parts respectively correspond to the database read and write plugins supported by DataX. For example, when you migrate table data from a MySQL database to OceanBase Database, the data must be read from the MySQL database and then written to OceanBase Database. In this case, the `txtfilereader` plug-in of the MySQL database and the `oceanbasev10writer` plug-in of OceanBase Database are used. The following sections describe the `txtfilereader` and `oceanbasev10writer` plugins.

### `txtfilereader` plug-in

The `txtfilereader` plug-in reads data from the local file system. converts the data, and transfers the data to the writer through DataX.

<!-- For more information about the features and parameters, see [`txtfilereader` plug-in](https://github.com/alibaba/DataX/blob/master/txtfilereader/doc/txtfilereader.md). -->

### `OceanbaseV10Writer` plug-in

The `oceanbasev10writer` plug-in writes data to the destination table in OceanBase Database.
To be specific, the `oceanbasev10writer` plug-in connects to a remote OceanBase database from a Java client (MySQL JDBC or OBClient) by using OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) and executes the corresponding `INSERT` statement to write the data to the remote OceanBase database. The data is committed in the OceanBase database in batches. 

`oceanbasev10writer` uses the DataX framework to obtain the protocol data generated by the reader and then generates an `INSERT` statement. If a primary key or unique key conflict occurs during data writes, you can update all fields in the table by using the `replace` mode for a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, and by using only the insert mode for an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database. For performance purposes, the batch write mode is used. A write request is initiated only when the number of rows reaches the specified threshold. 

### DataX configuration file

The following example shows the content of the configuration file:

```json
{
  "job": {
    "content": [
      {
        "reader": {
          "name": "streamreader",
          "parameter": {
            "sliceRecordCount": 10,
            "column": [
              {
                "type": "long",
                "value": "10"
              },
              {
                "type": "string",
                "value": "hello, world-DataX"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        "writer": {
          "name": "streamwriter",
          "parameter": {
            "encoding": "UTF-8",
            "print": true
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    "setting": {
      "speed": {
        "channel": 2
       }
    }
  }
}
```

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>DataX migrates only table data. Therefore, you need to create the corresponding table schema in the destination database in advance. </p>
</main>

Place the `JSON` configuration file in the `job` directory of DataX or in a custom path. Here is a sample command:

```shell
$bin/datax.py job/stream2stream.json
```

The output is as follows:

```shell
<.....>

2021-08-26 11:06:09.217 [job-0] INFO  JobContainer - PerfTrace not enable!
2021-08-26 11:06:09.218 [job-0] INFO  StandAloneJobContainerCommunicator - Total 20 records, 380 bytes | Speed 38B/s, 2 records/s | Error 0 records, 0 bytes |  All Task WaitWriterTime 0.000s |  All Task WaitReaderTime 0.000s | Percentage 100.00%
2021-08-26 11:06:09.223 [job-0] INFO  JobContainer -

Average task traffic: 38 B/s
Record writing speed: 2 rec/s
Total number of read records: 20
Total read and write failures: 0
```

After a DataX task is executed, a simple task report is returned, providing information such as the average output traffic, write speed, and total number of read and write failures. 

The `settings` parameter of DataX tasks can define the speed and error log tolerance. 

```json
"setting": {
            "speed": {
                "channel": 10 
            },
            "errorLimit": {
                "record": 10,
                "percentage": 0.1
            }
        }
```

where

* `errorLimit` specifies the maximum number of erroneous records allowed for the task. If this limit is exceeded, the task is interrupted and exits. 
* `channel`: the number of concurrent tasks. A larger number of concurrent tasks indicate higher migration performance. However, you must consider the read stress of the source database, network transmission performance, and write performance of the destination database. 

## Prepare the environment

Download the .tar package from `http://datax-opensource.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/datax.tar.gz`.

Decompress the installation package:

The parameters are described in the following table.

| Parameter | Description |
|----------|--------------------|
| name | The name of the database plug-in corresponding to the reader or writer that connects to the database. The reader plug-in of MySQL Database is `mysqlreader`, and the writer plug-in of OceanBase Database is `oceanbasev10writer`. For more information about the reader and writer plug-ins, see [DataX data source guide](https://github.com/alibaba/datax).  |
| jdbcUrl | The JDBC URL of the database to which you want to connect. The value is a JSON array and multiple URLs can be entered for a database. You must enter at least one JDBC URL in the JSON array. The value must be entered in compliance with the MySQL official format. You can also specify a configuration property in the URL. For more information, see [Configuration Properties](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-j/en/connector-j-reference-configuration-properties.html) in the MySQL documentation.  <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p><ul><li>The JDBC URL must be included in the `connection` section of the code. </li> <li>OceanBase Database must be connected by using an OBProxy. The port is 2883 by default. </li><li> You do not need to use <code>[]</code> to enclose the connection string of the JDBC URL of the writer. However, you must use <code>[]</code> to enclose the connection string of the JDBC URL of the reader.</li></ul></p></main>  <ul><li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| username | The username for logging on to the database.</li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| password | The password of the specified username required to log on to the database.</li> <li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| table | The table to be synchronized. The value is a JSON array and multiple tables can be specified at the same time. When you specify multiple tables, make sure that they use the same schema structure. mysqlreader does not verify whether the specified tables belong to the same logic table. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The table string must be included in the `connection` section of the code. </p></main> <ul><li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| column | The set of names of columns to be synchronized in the configured table. The values are specified in a JSON array. We recommend that you do not set this parameter to `['*']`, because the configuration changes with the table schema. We recommend that you specify the column names instead.  Column pruning is supported. You can export only the specified columns. Column reordering is supported. You can export columns without following the column order in the schema. You can specify constants in the SQL syntax format of MySQL, for example, `["id", "`table`", "1", "'bazhen.csy'", "null", "to_char(a + 1)", "2.3" , "true"]`.  <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p><ul><li><code>id</code> is a regular column name. </li> <li><code>table</code> is the name of the column that includes a reserved word.</li> <li><code>1</code> is an integer constant. </li>  <li><code>bazhen.csy</code> is a string constant. </li> <li><code>null</code> is a null pointer. </li> <li><code>to_char(a +1)</code> is an expression. </li> <li><code>2.3</code> is a floating-point number. </li><li><code>true</code> is a Boolean value. </li></ul> </p></main> <ul><li>Required: Yes.</li> <li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
| where | The filter condition. mysqlreader assembles the specified column, table, and `WHERE` clause into an SQL statement. Then, mysqlreader extracts data based on this SQL statement. To synchronize data of the current day, you can set the condition of the WHERE clause to `gmt_create > $bizdate`.  <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>You cannot set the condition of the <code>WHERE</code> clause to <code>limit 10</code>, because <code>limit</code> is not a valid key in the <code>WHERE</code> clause of an SQL statement.  A <code>WHERE</code> clause allows you to orderly synchronize the incremental business data. If you do not specify the <code>WHERE</code> clause or do not specify the <code>key</code> or <code>value</code> of the <code>WHERE</code> clause, DataX performs full synchronization. </p></main><ul><li>Required: No.</li><li>Default value: None.</li></ul> |
