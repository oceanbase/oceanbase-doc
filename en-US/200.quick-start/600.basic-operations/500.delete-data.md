Delete data 
================================

Use the DELETE statement to delete data. 

Example:

Create Tables `t1` and `t2` that contain the following data: Table `t2` is a key-based partition table and the partition names are automatically generated by the system according to the partitioning command rules. That is, the partition names are `p0`, `p1`, `p2`, and `p3`. 

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 int primary key, c2 int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)
obclient> INSERT t1 VALUES(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.00 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
obclient> SELECT * FROM t1; 
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  1 |    1 |
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
|  4 |    4 |
+----+------+
4 rows in set (0.06 sec)

obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 int primary key, c2 int) partition BY key(c1) partitions 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.19 sec)
obclient> INSERT INTO t2 VALUES(5,5),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
+----+------+
| c1 | c2   |
+----+------+
|  5 |    5 |
|  1 |    1 |
|  2 |    2 |
|  3 |    3 |
+----+------+
4 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```



* Delete data in a single table: Delete rows where `c1 = 2` from Table `t1`. The values in Column `c1` are primary keys. 

  ```sql
  obclient> DELETE FROM t1 WHERE c1 = 2;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   |
  +----+------+
  |  1 |    1 |
  |  3 |    3 |
  |  4 |    4 |
  +----+------+
  3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
  ```

  

* Delete data in a single table: Delete the data in the first row sorted by Column `c2 `from Table `t1`. 

  ```sql
  obclient> DELETE FROM t1 ORDER BY c2 LIMIT 1;
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   |
  +----+------+
  |  2 |    2 |
  |  3 |    3 |
  |  4 |    4 |
  +----+------+
  3 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```

  

* Delete data in a single table: Delete data in Partition `p2` from Table `t2`. 

  ```sql
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t2 PARTITION(p2); 
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   |
  +----+------+
  |  1 |    1 |
  |  2 |    2 |
  |  3 |    3 |
  +----+------+
  3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
  
  obclient> DELETE FROM t2  PARTITION(p2); 
  Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   | 
  +----+------+
  |  5 |    5 |
  +----+------+
  1 row in set (0.02 sec)
  ```

  

* Delete data in two or more tables: Delete rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1` from Tables `t1` and `t2`. 

  ```sql
  obclient> DELETE t1, t2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
  Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   |
  +----+------+
  |  4 |    4 |
  +----+------+
  1 row in set (0.01 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   |
  +----+------+ 
  |  5 |    5 | 
  +----+------+
  1 row in set (0.01 sec)
  ```

  

* Delete data in two or more tables:Delete rows where `t1.c1 = t2.c1` from Tables `t1` and `t2`.

  ```sql
  obclient> DELETE FROM t1, t2 USING t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
  Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.02 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
  +----+------+
  | c1 | c2   |
  +----+------+
  |  4 |    4 |
  +----+------+
  1 row in set (0.01 sec)
  
  obclient> SELECT * FROM t2;
  Empty set (0.01 sec)
  ```
