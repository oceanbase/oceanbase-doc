# Configuration before deployment

Before you deploy an OceanBase cluster, you must check the system environment and configurations.

## View resources

If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you deploy the OceanBase cluster on servers with the same hardware and software configurations. If you are deploying OceanBase Database on a single server, you can skip this section.

OceanBase Database supports operating systems such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.X, CentOS 7.X, and Anolis OS 8.X. For more information, see [Software and hardware requirements](../200.local-deployment/100.requirements-for-software-and-hardware.md).

> **Note**
>
> The configuration files mentioned in this topic refer to files that are configured when you use OBD to deploy OceanBase Database. For more information, see [Example configuration files](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/tree/master/example).

## View the NIC name

You need to specify the NIC for the `devname` parameter. For example:

```bash
# Please set devname as the network adaptor's name whose ip is  in the setting of severs.
# if set severs as "127.0.0.1", please set devname as "lo"
# if current ip is 192.168.1.10, and the ip's network adaptor's name is "eth0", please use "eth0"
devname: eth0
```

Run the following command to view the NIC name:

```bash
ifconfig
```

> **Notice**
>
> To run the `ifconfig` command, you must install the `net-tools` dependencies.

## Enable password-free SSH logon

### Terms

* Central control server

   The server that stores the installation package and cluster configuration information of OceanBase Database.

* Target server

   The server where you want to install OceanBase Database.

### Prerequisites

You have the root user privileges on the target server.

### Procedure

You can take the following steps to set up password-free logon through SSH:

1. Run the following command on the central control server to check whether the key exists:

   ```bash
   ls ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

   If yes, you do not need to generate a new private SSH key.

2. Optional. Run the following command on the central control server to generate the public and private SSH keys:

   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```

3. Run the following command on the central control server to log on to the target server:

   ```bash
   ssh-copy-id  root@<server_ip>
   ```

<!--
> **Notice**
>
> You need to run the foregoing commands only on the central control server.
-->

### Appendix: Reference scripts

We recommend that you use the following script. To run this script, you must have the sudo privilege.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/bash

   SERVERS=("root@172.19.x.x root@172.19.x.x" "root@172.19.x.x" "root@172.19.x.x")
   PASSWORD="test@"
   keygen() {
   yum -y install expect
   expect -c "
      spawn ssh-keygen -t rsa
      expect {
         *(/root/.ssh/id_rsa):* { send -- \r;exp_continue}
         *(y/n)* { send -- y\r;exp_continue}
         *Enter* { send -- \r;exp_continue}
         *(y/n)* { send -- y\r;exp_continue}
         *Enter* { send -- \r;exp_continue}
         eof {exit 0}
      }
      expect eof
   "
   }
   copy(){
   expect -c "
      set timeout -1
      spawn ssh-copy-id $1
      expect {
         *(yes/no)* { send -- yes\r; exp_continue }
         *password:* { send -- $PASSWORD\r; exp_continue}
         eof {exit 0}
      }
      expect eof
   "
   }
   ssh_copy_id_to_all(){
   keygen ;
   for host in ${SERVERS[@]}
   do
         copy $host
   done
   }
   ssh_copy_id_to_all
```

> **Notice**
>
> You must replace the list of hosts and the password in the script with the actual list of servers and password.

## Configure the clock source

If you deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster, you must ensure that the time of all servers in the cluster is synchronized. Otherwise, the cluster cannot be started and exceptions will be thrown. If you have already configured the Network Time Protocol (NTP) clock source, no need to do it again.

The clocks of servers in the OceanBase cluster must be synchronized. Otherwise, the OceanBase cluster may not start or will encounter operational exceptions. A physical server is considered synchronous with the clock source server when the clock error between them is 50 ms or lower. The tolerable clock error of an OceanBase cluster cannot exceed 100 ms. When the clock error exceeds 100 ms, the cluster may become leaderless. You can synchronize the clock and restart the OceanBase cluster to restore it to normal.

### Prerequisites

You have the root user privileges on all OBServers.

### Procedure

Perform the following steps to configure the NTP clock source.

1. Run the following command on each server to install NTP:

   ```bash
   yum install ntp ntpdate -y
   ```

2. Run the following command to check the NTP connection to the server:

   When the time difference between the server and the NTP server is within 50 ms, the clocks are considered synchronized.

   ```bash
   [root@centos-01 /root]#ntpq -4p
   remote refid st t when poll reach delay offset jitter
   ==============================================================================
   *time6.aliyun.co xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx 2 u 712 1024 377 21.951 4.253 4.208
   ```

3. (Optional) Enable the NTP server.

   If you already have an NTP server, skip this step. The following example describes how to enable time synchronization by taking the server `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` as the NTP server.
   1. Edit the configuration file.

      Log on to the NTP server as a root user and run the following command to open the configuration file:

      ```bash
      vi /etc/ntp.conf
      ```

      Add the following content to the configuration file:

      ```bash
      server <yout_ntp_server_ip>
      ```

      Save and close the file.

   2. Run the following command to restart the NTP server:

      ```bash
      service ntpd restart
      ```

   3. Run the following command to check whether the NTP service is enabled:

      ```bash
      ps -ef | grep -i ntpd
      ```

   4. Run the following command to enable the NTP service upon startup.

      ```bash
      chkconfig ntpd on
      ```

4. Enable the NTP service on an OBServer.

   > **Notice**
   >
   > You can enable the NTP service on an OBServer five minutes later after the NTP server is started. Otherwise, the system prompts "no server suitable for synchronization found".

   1. Log on to OceanBase Database as the root user.

   2. Run the following command to stop the NTP service:

      ```bash
      service ntpd stop
      ```

   3. Run the following command to synchronize the time with the NTP server:

      ```bash
      ntpdate xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
      ```

   4. Edit the configuration file.

      Run the following command to open the configuration file:

      ```bash
      vi /etc/ntp.conf
      ```

      Add the following content to the configuration file:

      ```bash
      server <yout_ntp_server_ip>
      ```

   5. Run the following command to start the NTP service:

      ```bash
      /etc/init.d/ntpd start
      ```

5. Verify whether the configuration is successful:

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   ntpstat
   ```

   The following output is returned:

   ```bash
   synchronised to NTP server (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) at stratum 3
   time correct to within 2 ms
   polling server every 64 s
   ```

   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   timedatectl
   ```

   The following output is returned:

   ```bash
         Local time: Thu 2021-04-22 11:02:32 CST
     Universal time: Thu 2021-04-22 03:02:32 UTC
           RTC time: Thu 2021-04-22 11:02:32
          Time zone: Asia/Shanghai (CST, +0800)
        NTP enabled: yes
   NTP synchronized: yes
    RTC in local TZ: yes
         DST active: n/a
   ```

   If the command output is as expected, the NTP service is running.

## Disk planning

The running of an OBServer relies on the data disk, clog disk, and installation disk where OceanBase Database is installed. If you are an individual user, you can put all the data on a single disk and skip this section. If you are an enterprise user, you must separately mount your data to three disks.

If you do not have three disks for a server, or you are using Redundant Array of Independent Disks (RAID), you need to partition the disk or disk array into logical volumes. We recommend that you plan the following disks:

* Data disk

   The data disk is mounted to the `data_dir` directory, and is used for storing the baseline data. When you start OceanBase Database for the first time, the `${data_dir}/sstable` directory is automatically created. The size of the data disk is determined by the `datafile_disk_percentage` parameter. The default value of the `datafile_disk_percentage` parameter is `95`. Once you have created the `data_dir` directory, you cannot resize it. You can scale OceanBase Database out or in by adding or removing servers. OceanBase Database does not support disks that are added directly to a server.

* Clog disk

   The clog disk is mounted to the `redo_dir` directory. We recommend that you set the size of the clog disk to at least 3 times that of the memory for the OceanBase Database. The clog disk contains files of a fixed size. These files are located in the `${redo_dir}/{clog,ilog,slog}` installation directory, and are created and cleaned up as needed. When the total size of clog files reaches 80% of the total disk capacity, automatic cleanup is triggered. However, the clog files can be cleaned up only when the corresponding memory data has been compacted and merged with the baseline data. For a given size of memory data, the size of clog files is approximately three times larger. Therefore, the maximum space required for the clog disk is directly proportional to the total amount of data after two major compactions. You can use the empirical formula for evaluation: Size of clog files = Maximum memory space for incremental data × 3 or 4.

* OceanBase Database installation disk

   The disk for the installation of OceanBase Database is mounted to the `home_path` directory. We recommend that you reserve at least 200 GB to save log files for 7 or more days. The RPM package of OceanBase Database is located in the `${home_path}` directory. The baseline data files and clog files are mapped to the preceding data disk and clog disk through soft links. The runtime logs of OceanBase Database are located in the `${home_path}/log` directory. The number of runtime logs will keep increasing because OceanBase Database cannot automatically delete them. Therefore, you need to regularly delete the runtime logs.

After you plan the disks, run the following command to view the disk information:

```bash
df -h
```

The following output is returned:

```bash
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
devtmpfs         31G     0   31G   0% /dev
tmpfs            31G     0   31G   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs            31G  516K   31G   1% /run
tmpfs            31G     0   31G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
/dev/vda1       493G  171G  302G  37% /

/dev/vdb1     492G    73M   467G  1%  /home/admin/oceanbase
```

Result description:

* The `/data` string indicates the information of the data disk, which is 1 TB in size.

* The `/redo` string indicates the information of the log disk where the REDO logs are stored.

* The `/home/admin/oceanbase` string indicates the information of the installation disk where the binary files and runtime logs of OceanBase Database are stored.

## Configure the limits.conf file

You can configure the `limits.conf` file to limit the number of processes. If you are an individual user, you can skip this section. If you are an enterprise user, you must configure the `limits.conf` file.

You can modify the limit on resources by using the following two methods:

* Modify the limit at the session level when OceanBase Database is started.

* Modify the limit globally by using the `limits.conf` file in the `/etc/security/` directory.

OceanBase Database processes can be limited in terms of the following parameters: Stack, Open Files, and Core File Size. Stack refers to the maximum stack size. Open Files refers to the maximum number of file handles. Core File Size refers to the maximum size of core files.

### Modify parameters

> **Note**
>
> You must perform this operation on each server.

The following example shows how set the value of the session-level Stack parameter to `unlimited`, the Open Files parameter to`655350`, and the Core File Size parameter to `unlimited`.

Run the following command to open the `limits.conf` file in the `/etc/security/` directory:

```bash
vi /etc/security/limits.conf
```

Add the following content to the `/limits.conf` file in the `/etc/security/` directory:

```bash
root soft nofile 655350
root hard nofile 655350
* soft nofile 655350
* hard nofile 655350
* soft stack 20480
* hard stack 20480
* soft nproc 655360
* hard nproc 655360
* soft core unlimited
* hard core unlimited
```

### View parameters

Log off from the session and log on again. Run the following command to view whether the parameters have taken effect:

```bash
ulimit -a
```

## Configure the sysctl.conf file

To improve the Linux performance, and ensure the normal running of OceanBase Database, you need to modify the parameters in the `sysctl.conf` file of each server before the installation of OceanBase Database. If you are an individual user, you can skip this section. If you are an enterprise user, you must configure the `sysctl.conf` file.

> **Note**
>
> You must perform this operation on each server.

### Modify parameters

Run the following command to open the `sysctl.conf` file in the `/etc/` directory:

```bash
vi /etc/sysctl.conf
```

Add the following content to the `sysctl.conf` file in the `/etc/` directory:

```bash
# for oceanbase
## Modify the limit on the asynchronous I/O in the kernel.
fs.aio-max-nr=1048576

## Optimize the network.
net.core.somaxconn = 2048
net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 10000
net.core.rmem_default = 16777216
net.core.wmem_default = 16777216
net.core.rmem_max = 16777216
net.core.wmem_max = 16777216

net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 3500 65535
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
net.ipv4.conf.default.rp_filter = 1
net.ipv4.conf.default.accept_source_route = 0
net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies = 0

net.ipv4.tcp_wmem = 4096 65536 16777216
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 16384
net.ipv4.tcp_fin_timeout = 15
net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 16384
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_tw_recycle = 1
net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle=0

vm.swappiness = 0
vm.min_free_kbytes = 2097152

# Specify the data directory of OceanBase Database.
kernel.core_pattern = /data/core-%e-%p-%t
```

Note that `/data` in the `kernel.core_pattern` field indicates the `data` directory of OceanBase Database. If you modify the configuration file for a test, you can set `fs.aio-max-nr=1048576`.

### Load parameters

Run the following command to load the parameters and make the changes take effect.

```bash
sysctl -p
```

## Disable the firewall and SELinux

If you are an individual user, you can skip this section. If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you disable the firewall and SELinux.

> **Note**
>
> You must perform this operation on each server.

### Disable the firewall

Run the following commands in the shown sequence to disable the firewall.

```bash
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl status firewalld
```

### Disable SELinux

Run the following command to open the `/etc/selinux/config` configuration file:

```bash
vi /etc/selinux/config
```

In the `/etc/selinux/config` file, change the value of `SELINUX` to `disabled`.

```bash
SELINUX=disabled
```

Run the following command or restart the server for the change to take effect:

```bash
setenforce 0
```

Run the following command to check whether the change has taken effect:

```bash
sestatus
```

## Create a user

If you are an individual user, you can use the root user and skip this section. If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you create non-root users for the servers to ensure data security. You can create frequently used users as needed.

> **Note**
>
> You must perform this operation on each server.

Perform the following steps to create a user. The following example shows how to create an admin user.

* Run the following commands to create the admin user:

   ```bash
   useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
   mkdir -p /home/admin
   sudo chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

* Run the following command to set a password for the admin user:

   ```unknow
   passwd admin
   ```

* Optional. Set sudo privileges for the admin user.

   Open the `/etc/sudoers` file. Add the following code to `/etc/sudoers`:

   ```bash
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

* Run the following command to view the directory access privilege:

   ```bash
   ls -al
   ```

   The following output is returned:

   ```bash
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb 9 18:43
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 Feb 9 18:43 log1
   ```

   If the admin user does not have the access privilege, run the following commands as the root user:

   ```bash
   chown -R admin:admin /data
   chown -R admin:admin /redo
   chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

   Note that you need to specify your actual mount directories. The `/data`, `/redo`, and `/home/admin` directories in the preceding commands are only examples for your reference.
