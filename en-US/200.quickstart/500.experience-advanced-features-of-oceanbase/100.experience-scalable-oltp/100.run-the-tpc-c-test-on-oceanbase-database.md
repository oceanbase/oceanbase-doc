# Run the TPC-C benchmark in OceanBase Database

The TPC-C benchmark test is one of the performance test standards defined by the Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC). Since its release, the TPC-C benchmark test has become an important reference for performance tests in the database industry. Major database vendors around the world submit their test results to the TPC from time to time, expecting to rank higher in the TPC-C benchmark test. OceanBase Database set new world records in the TPC-C benchmark test twice in 2019 and 2020 as the first distributed relational database in the list. 

This topic describes how to run the TPC-C benchmark test in OceanBase Database to try out its online transaction processing (OLTP) capability.

## TPC-C overview

### Database model

The TPC-C benchmark test specifies the initial state of the database under test, which is the rules for generating data in the database. According to the rules, the ITEM table contains 100,000 types of commodities, and the number of warehouses can be adjusted. Assuming that the `WAREHOUSE` table contains `W` records, then:

- The `STOCK` table must contain W × 100,000 records, indicating that each warehouse corresponds to the stock data of 100,000 types of commodities.
- The `DISTRICT` table must contain W × 10 records, indicating that each warehouse serves 10 districts.
- The `CUSTOMER` table must contain W × 10 × 3,000 records, indicating that 3,000 customers are distributed in each district.
- The `HISTORY` table must contain W × 10 × 3,000 records, with one transaction history record for each customer.
- The `ORDER` table must contain W × 10 × 3,000 records, indicating that 3,000 orders are generated in each district. The last 900 orders generated will be added to the `NEW-ORDER` table, and 5 to 15 order lines will be randomly generated for each order.

During the test, a terminal is deployed in each district to simulate user services. Each terminal cyclically performs all types of transactions within its service life. After the terminal completes the cycle of one transaction, it enters the cycle of the next transaction.

After a customer places an order, an order containing several order lines is generated and added to the `NEW-ORDER` table.

A transaction history record is generated after a customer pays for an order. Each order contains 10 order lines on average, and 1% of the order lines are obtained from remote warehouses. These are the nine data tables in the TPC-C model.

### Transaction types

The TPC-C benchmark involves the following five transaction types:

- New-Order transaction: A New-Order transaction randomly selects 5 to 15 commodities from a warehouse to create an order. A fixed 1% of the transactions are chosen to simulate errors and rolled back. Generally, transactions of this type cannot exceed 45% of all types of transactions.
- Payment transaction: A payment transaction updates the balance of a customer to reflect the payment of the customer. Transactions of this type account for 43% of all types of transactions.
- Order-Status transaction: An Order-Status transaction randomly selects a customer to query the latest order of the customer and displays the status of each commodity in the order. Transactions of this type account for 4% of all types of transactions.
- Delivery transaction: A delivery transaction batch-processes orders, updates the balances of the customers who placed the orders, and deletes the orders from the New-Order table. Transactions of this type account for 4% of all types of transactions.
- Stock-Level transaction: A Stock-Level transaction analyzes the stock level status of commodities. Transactions of this type account for 4% of all types of transactions.

## Prepare the environment

### Prepare an OceanBase cluster

The performance of OceanBase Database may vary depending on the type of OceanBase cluster that you have deployed. If you have deployed a single-node OceanBase cluster, you can observe the performance of OceanBase Database in standalone mode. If you want to try out the scalable OLTP capability of OceanBase Database's distributed architecture, it is recommended that you deploy an OceanBase cluster with at least three nodes.

The example below uses the tenant mode `MySQL` and the tenant name `test`. To create your own tenant, follow the steps in [Try out the multi-tenant feature](../400.experience-multi-tenant-features.md).

### Install BenchmarkSQL

The TPC has defined strict and detailed test standards for the TPC-C benchmark. Individual developers can simulate TPC-C benchmark scenarios using common open-source test tools. This topic uses BenchmarkSQL as an example. You can download BenchmarkSQL from [BenchmarkSQL official website](https://sourceforge.net/projects/benchmarksql/).

### Adapt BenchmarkSQL 5.0

BenchmarkSQL 5.0 does not support running the TPC-C benchmark with OceanBase Database. This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to modify the BenchmarkSQL 5.0 source code to support OceanBase Database.

1. Add OceanBase Database-related information to the `benchmarksql-5.0/src/client/jTPCC.java` file.

   ```java
   if (iDB.equals("firebird"))
           dbType = DB_FIREBIRD;
       else if (iDB.equals("oracle"))
           dbType = DB_ORACLE;
       else if (iDB.equals("postgres"))
           dbType = DB_POSTGRES;
       else if (iDB.equals("oceanbase"))
           dbType = DB_OCEANBASE;
       else
       {
           log.error("unknown database type '" + iDB + "'");
           return;
       }
   ```

   Modify the `benchmarksql-5.0/src/client/jTPCCConfig.java` file to add OceanBase Database as a database type.

   ```java
   public final static int         
   DB_UNKNOWN = 0,
   DB_FIREBIRD = 1,
   DB_ORACLE = 2,
   DB_POSTGRES = 3,
   DB_OCEANBASE = 4;
   ```

2. Add the alias `AS L` to the SQL subquery in the `benchmarksql-5.0/src/client/jTPCCConnection.java` file.

   ```java
   default:
               stmtStockLevelSelectLow = dbConn.prepareStatement(
                   "SELECT count(*) AS low_stock FROM (" +
                   "    SELECT s_w_id, s_i_id, s_quantity " +
                   "        FROM bmsql_stock " +
                   "        WHERE s_w_id = ? AND s_quantity < ? AND s_i_id IN (" +
                   "            SELECT ol_i_id " +
                   "                FROM bmsql_district " +
                   "                JOIN bmsql_order_line ON ol_w_id = d_w_id " +
                   "                 AND ol_d_id = d_id " +
                   "                 AND ol_o_id >= d_next_o_id - 20 " +
                   "                 AND ol_o_id < d_next_o_id " +
                   "                WHERE d_w_id = ? AND d_id = ? " +
                   "        ) " +
                   "    )AS L");
               break;
   ```

3. Recompile the modified source code.

   ```shell
   [oceanbase@testdrier test]# cd benchmarksql-5.0
   [oceanbase@testdrier benchmarksql-5.0]# ant
   ```

4. Modify the `benchmarksql-5.0/run/funcs.sh` file to add OceanBase Database as a database type.

   ```java
   function setCP()
   {
      case "$(getProp db)" in
   firebird)
       cp="../lib/firebird/*:../lib/*"
       ;;
   oracle)
       cp="../lib/oracle/*"
       if [ ! -z "${ORACLE_HOME}" -a -d ${ORACLE_HOME}/lib ] ; then
    cp="${cp}:${ORACLE_HOME}/lib/*"
       fi
       cp="${cp}:../lib/*"
       ;;
   postgres)
       cp="../lib/postgres/*:../lib/*"
       ;;
   oceanbase)
       cp="../lib/oceanbase/*:../lib/*"
       ;;
      esac
      myCP=".:${cp}:../dist/*"
      export myCP
   }

   ... Omitted

   case "$(getProp db)" in
      firebird|oracle|postgres|oceanbase)
      ;;
      "") echo "ERROR: missing db= config option in ${PROPS}" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
      *)  echo "ERROR: unsupported database type 'db=$(getProp db)' in ${PROPS}" >&2
      exit 1
      ;;
   esac
   ```

5. Modify the `benchmarksql-5.0/run/runDatabaseBuild.sh` file.

   ```java
   AFTER_LOAD="indexCreates foreignKeys extraHistID buildFinish"
   # Modified code:
   AFTER_LOAD="indexCreates buildFinish"
   ```

### Modify the configuration file

The `props.ob` configuration file is stored in the `run/` directory of BenchmarkSQL.

   ```java
   db=oceanbase
   driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
   conn=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:2881/tpccdb?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=utf-8&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&allowMultiQueries=true
   user=root@test
   password=****

   warehouses=10
   loadWorkers=2
   //fileLocation=/data/temp/

   terminals=10
   //To run specified transactions per terminal- runMins must equal zero
   runTxnsPerTerminal=0
   //To run for specified minutes- runTxnsPerTerminal must equal zero
   runMins=10
   //Number of total transactions per minute
   limitTxnsPerMin=0

   //Set to true to run in 4.x compatible mode. Set to false to use the
   //entire configured database evenly.
   terminalWarehouseFixed=true

   //The following five values must add up to 100
   newOrderWeight=45
   paymentWeight=43
   orderStatusWeight=4
   deliveryWeight=4
   stockLevelWeight=4

   // Directory name to create for collecting detailed result data.
   // Comment this out to suppress.
   resultDirectory=my_result_%tY-%tm-%td_%tH%tM%tS
   osCollectorScript=./misc/os_collector_linux.py
   osCollectorInterval=1
   //osCollectorSSHAddr=user@dbhost
   //osCollectorDevices=net_eth0 blk_sda
   ```

If the servers have high configurations, you can set this parameter to a large value, for example, 100. If the servers have limited configurations, you can set this parameter to a small value, for example, 10. High concurrency increases memory consumption, which leads to errors or even failures in data loading. </li><li><code>terminals</code>: the number of concurrent users for stress testing. We recommend that you set this parameter to a value that is not greater than the number of warehouses × 10. Otherwise, unnecessary lock waits occur. We recommend that you set this parameter to at most 1,000 in a production environment and to not smaller than 100 in a test environment. </li><li><code>runMins</code>: the duration of the performance test in minutes. Longer duration poses higher challenges to the performance and stability of the database. We recommend that you set this parameter to at least 10 in a test environment and at least 60 in a production environment. </li></p>

## Data preparations

### Create a test database

In the `test` tenant, create a test database named `tpccdb`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE tpccdb;
```

### Create a table

The table creation script is usually stored in the `run/sql.common` directory of BenchmarkSQL or a specified directory. You can use the following table creation script to create partitioned tables. Most tables are hash-partitioned by warehouse ID. The number of partitions depends on the volume of data and the number of servers under test.
If your cluster contains only one or three servers, set the number of partitions to 9. If 5,000 warehouses or a large number of servers in the cluster are under test, you can set the number of partitions to 99.

```sql

```

Run the following command to create the tables:

```shell
./runSQL.sh props.ob sql.common/tableCreates_parts.sql
```

### Load data

Loading data means data initialization. The data loading speed depends on the server configuration. A higher server configuration indicates a higher data loading speed.

```shell
./runLoader.sh props.ob
```

The `INSERT` SQL statement for loading data uses the batch insert feature, which is specified in the JDBC URL field in the `props.ob` file. The write performance is significantly improved with this feature enabled.

### Create indexes

After the data is initialized, log on to the `test` tenant of the cluster and run the following command to create two indexes in the `tpccdb` database.

```sql
[root@obce-0000 run]# cat sql.common/indexCreates.sql
CREATE INDEX bmsql_customer_idx1
  on  bmsql_customer (c_w_id, c_d_id, c_last, c_first) local;
CREATE INDEX bmsql_oorder_idx1
  on  bmsql_oorder (o_w_id, o_d_id, o_carrier_id, o_id) local;
```

## Start the test

Before you start the performance test, we recommend that you log on to the tenant and perform a major compaction to obtain better test results. You can manually trigger a major compaction using the following method, but this step is not mandatory.

```sql
obclient[oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM MAJOR FREEZE;
```

Run the following command to query the state of the major compaction. If the result returns IDLE, the major compaction is completed.

```sql
MySQL [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_ZONE_MAJOR_COMPACTION;
+-----------+-------+---------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
| TENANT_ID | ZONE  | BROADCAST_SCN       | LAST_SCN            | LAST_FINISH_TIME           | START_TIME                 | STATUS |
+-----------+-------+---------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
|         1 | zone1 | 1664503499339325817 | 1664503499339325817 | 2022-09-30 10:05:19.442115 | 2022-09-30 10:04:59.369976 | IDLE   |
|      1002 | zone1 |                   1 |                   1 | 1970-01-01 08:00:00.000000 | 1970-01-01 08:00:00.000000 | IDLE   |
+-----------+-------+---------------------+---------------------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+
2 rows in set 
```

After the major compaction is completed, run the following command to start the test:

```shell
./runBenchmark.sh props.ob
```

In the TPC-C benchmark, the tpmC value (transactions per minute) measures the maximum effective throughput of the system. In fact, New-Order transactions are counted. Therefore, the tpmC value is the number of orders processed per minute.

## Try out the scalable OLTP capability of OceanBase Database

Regardless of whether you use a single-node or multi-node cluster in the preceding test, only the zone where the leaders of the tenant reside participates in transaction processing. This is because, by default, the leaders of the tenant are distributed to zones by priority.

As a distributed database, OceanBase Database allows you to shuffle leader partitions of a tenant to multiple zones, to enable linear scaling of computing and processing capabilities across servers.

If your cluster contains three or more nodes, you only need to run the following command as the administrator and then start the test again.

```sql
ALTER TENANT test SET PRIMARY_ZONE'zone1';
```
