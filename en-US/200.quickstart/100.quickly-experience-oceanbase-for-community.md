## Deployment solutions

Three deployment solutions are provided for you to quickly get started with OceanBase Database. You can choose a solution based on the actual situation.

* Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment

   If you have only one server, you can quickly build a demo environment to deploy OceanBase Database. The demo database provides basic features for you to quickly learn about OceanBase Database, but does not support distributed capabilities or high availability. Therefore, long-term use is not recommended. For more information, see **Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment**.

* Solution 2: Deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster

   You can choose this solution if you want to learn more about the distributed architecture and features of OceanBase Database. The cluster provides distributed capabilities and high availability apart from complete database features. To use this solution, you must have three hosts, each of which has four CPU cores, 10 GB of memory, and 50 GB of disk space. For more information, see **Solution 2: Deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster**.

* Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container (applicable only to the Community Edition)

   You can choose this solution if you want to deploy and manage OceanBase Database in a container. This solution has not been verified by large-scale practices and therefore is not recommended. For more information, see **Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container**.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p> The following describes the deployment of OceanBase Database on an x86-based CentOS Linux 7.9 platform. The procedure may be different on other OS platforms.  </p>
</main>

## Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment

If you have only one server available, you can run the `obd demo` command to quickly deploy a standalone OceanBase Database by following the procedure described in this section.

### Step 1: Download and install the all-in-one package

1. Download the all-in-one package and upload it to any directory on your server.

   * For OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition, contact the Technical Support to obtain the all-in-one package.

   * For OceanBase Database Community Edition, download the latest all-in-one package from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).

2. In the directory where the package is located, run the following commands to decompress and install the package:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ tar -xzf oceanbase-all-in-one-*.tar.gz
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./install.sh
   [admin@test001 bin]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy OceanBase Database on a single server

1. Run either of the following commands for quick deployment.

   * Enterprise Edition

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obd demo -c oceanbase,obproxy,obagent,prometheus,grafana
      ```

   * Community Edition

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obd demo
      ```

   By default, the `obd demo` command deploys OceanBase Database and its components (which are ODP, OBAgent, Grafana, and Prometheus) with minimum specifications and then starts them in the home directory of the current user. The name of the deployed cluster is fixed to `demo` in OBD. For more information about custom deployment, see [Quick deployment command](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000860052).

   You can use OBD commands to manage OceanBase Database. For more information about the commands, see [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000862273).

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>If you install Grafana or Prometheus, its access address is returned in the command output. On Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the program may fail to obtain a public IP address but return an intranet IP address. You must use a correct public IP address. </p>
   </main>

2. Run the connection command in the output to connect to the database.
   
   After the `obd demo` command is executed successfully, you will find the command to connect to OceanBase Database via OBClient. The examples are as follows:

   * Directly connect to the database through port 2881

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2881 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A
      ```

   * Connect to the database in proxy mode through ODP

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2883 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A
      ```

   For detailed instructions on how to connect to an OceanBase cluster using the OBClient client, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient](../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md). For more information about how to connect to OceanBase Database, see [Overview of connection methods](../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

3. (Optional) Configure the password.
   
   After you deploy OceanBase Database using the `obd demo` command, you can follow the steps below to configure the password for the demo cluster.

   1. Modify the configuration file.
  
      ```shell
      obd cluster edit-config demo
      ```

      After you execute the above command to open the configuration file, add `root_password: xxxx` under the `oceanbase-ce` (Community Edition) or `oceanbase` (Enterprise Edition) component in the configuration file. Then, save and exit. The following is an example:

      ```yaml
      oceanbase-ce:
        servers:
          - 127.0.0.1
        global:
          home_path: /home/admin/oceanbase-ce
          ... # Some parameters are omitted here.
          log_disk_size: 13G
          root_password: ******
      ```

   2. Restart the cluster.

      After you modify and save the configuration file, OBD will output the restart command that needs to be executed. You can directly copy and execute it. The following is an example:

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster edit-config demo
      Search param plugin and load ok
      Search param plugin and load ok
      Parameter check ok
      Save deploy "demo" configuration
      Use `obd cluster reload demo` to make changes take effect.
      Trace ID: 29dd12fa-3d73-11ee-91bc-00163e01cd7a
      If you want to view detailed obd logs, please run: obd display-trace 29dd12fa-3d73-11ee-91bc-00163e01cd7a
      ```

     As we can see in the output, after you modify the password for the `root@sys` user in the configuration file, you need to execute the `obd cluster reload demo` command to restart the demo cluster.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>You can also use the root user to log on to the sys tenant of the database and modify the user password by using the <code>ALTER USER</code> command. For more information, see <a href="../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/1800.alter-user-of-mysql-mode.md">ALTER USER</a>.</p>
   </main>
    

## Solution 2: Deploy an OceanBase cluster

If you have multiple servers available, you can run the `obd web` command to start the GUI of OBD and deploy a distributed OceanBase cluster on the GUI.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p> This section describes only simple operations needed to quickly deploy a distributed OceanBase cluster. For more information, see <a href="../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md">Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI of OBD</a>. </p>
</main> 

### Step 1: Download and install the all-in-one package

   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>The default port in the URL is 8680. You can use the <code>obd web -p &lt;PORT></code> command to specify a port. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>On Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the program may fail to obtain a public IP address but return an intranet IP address. You must use a correct public IP address to access the GUI. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The <code>obd web</code> command is bound to 0.0.0.0. In the case of multi-NIC deployment, you can access the GUI through any accessible IP address. </p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </main>
