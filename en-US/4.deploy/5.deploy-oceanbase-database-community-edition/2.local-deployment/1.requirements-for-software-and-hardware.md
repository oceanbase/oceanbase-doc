# Software and hardware requirements

OceanBase Database is a distributed cluster product that requires at least three servers in the production environment. In a learning environment, you can deploy a standalone instance. OceanBase Database is similar to conventional databases in deployment. In this topic, suggestions for the operating system, hardware, and software are provided based on best practices. These are the basis for OceanBase Database to achieve high performance and run stably.

## Software resources

The following table provides links for downloading the installation packages of OceanBase Database that are suitable for different operating systems.

| Operating system | RPM download link |

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If you plan to deploy an OceanBase cluster, make sure that all servers in the cluster have the same configurations. In this topic, the resource requirements on the performance test environment and production environment are for reference only. In later versions of OceanBase Database Community Edition, the requirement on memory will be lowered. </p>
