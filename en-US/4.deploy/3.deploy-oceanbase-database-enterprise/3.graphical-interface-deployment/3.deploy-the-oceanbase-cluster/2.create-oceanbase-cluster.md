# Create an OceanBase cluster

This topic describes how to create an OceanBase cluster in the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This topic takes OCP V4.0.0 as an example. The GUI varies with the OCP version. </p>
  </main>

## Prerequisites

* The logged-on user in the OCP console has the `CREATE CLUSTER` privilege.

* You have obtained the OceanBase RPM package to be uploaded.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

3. In the upper-right corner of the **Clusters** page, click **Create Cluster**.

4. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the basic information of the cluster.

   ![1](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/4.deploy-the-oceanbase-database/OCP/2%E5%88%9B%E5%BB%BA%E9%9B%86%E7%BE%A4%E5%9F%BA%E7%A1%80%E4%BF%A1%E6%81%AF.png)

   The following table describes the basic information parameters.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |-------------------|-----------------|
   | **Cluster Type** | You can select **Primary Cluster** or **Standby Cluster**. In this example, **Primary Cluster** is selected.  |
   | **Cluster Name** | The name of the cluster to be created. The cluster name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must start with a letter.  |
   | **root@sys Password** | This password can be customized or randomly generated. The password must meet the following complexity requirements: </br> <ol><li>Be 8 to 32 characters in length. </li><li>Contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. </li></ol>  </br>The following special characters are supported:`~!@#%^&*_-+=(){}[]:;,.?/)` </br>In addition, you can click **Copy Password** to copy a custom or randomly generated password to the clipboard.  |
   | **OceanBase Version** | The OceanBase Database version. You can select a version from the drop-down list or click **Add Version** at the bottom of the list to upload the RPM package of an OceanBase Database version.  |
   | **Associate OBProxy Cluster** | This option is used to associate existing ODP clusters. In this example, this option is disabled.  For information about how to associate an ODP cluster, see OCP User Guide.  |

5. On the **Create Cluster** page, configure the deployment mode of the cluster.

   By default, three zones are added for a cluster. To deploy more than three zones for the cluster, click **Add**. To deploy less than three zones for the cluster, click the Delete icon after the zone to be deleted.

   The following table describes the settings for each zone.

   | **Parameter** | **Description** |
   |--------------------|-----------------------------------|
   | **Zone Name** | Generally, a default name is provided. You can set a custom name as needed.  The zone name must be 2 to 48 characters in length and can contain letters, digits, and underscores (_). It must start with a letter.  |
   | **IDC** | The IDC of the zone. Hosts in a zone can be deployed in only the same IDC.  |
   | **Host Type (Optional)** | If you select a host type, the host list is filtered based on the host type.  |
   | **Selection Method** | Choose **Automatic** or **Manual**.  |
   | **Host** | You can select multiple IP addresses. If **Server Selection Method** is set to **Automatic**, you only need to enter the number of hosts, and OCP automatically selects the specified number of hosts from the available hosts. If **Server Selection Method** is set to **Manual**, you need to manually select the IP addresses from the list.  |
   | **RootServer** | You must select an IP address as the host for the RootService. If you want to create a multi-replica OceanBase cluster, you must specify this parameter for each zone.  |
   | **Zone Priority Rankings** | The priorities of the zones. This priority order affects the priority order of the primary zone of the sys tenant.  The left-side list shows all zones in the cluster. <ol><li>You can select one or more zones from the box on the left side to add them to the box on the right side. By default, the priority of a zone selected first is higher than that of the zone selected later. Zones selected at the same time have the same priority. </li><li> After you move the zones to the box on the right side, you can also drag them upward or downward to adjust their priority order. A zone takes priority over those beneath it.  </li></ol> |

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If a primary zone is specified, the region where the primary zone is located must have at least two zones and at least two full-featured replicas, with one replica for each zone. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

6. Optional. On the **Create Cluster** page, set the parameters.

   Enable **Parameter Settings** to modify parameters.

After the cluster is deployed, you need to create a business tenant. For more information, see [Create a tenant](../../../../7.reference/2.administrator-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants/2.create-a-tenant.md).
