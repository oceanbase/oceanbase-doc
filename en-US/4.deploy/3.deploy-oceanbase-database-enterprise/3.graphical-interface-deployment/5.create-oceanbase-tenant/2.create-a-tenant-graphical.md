# Create a tenant

After you confirm the remaining resources of the OceanBase cluster, you can create a tenant in the cluster based on your business requirements.

You can use one of the following methods to create a tenant.

* Create a tenant on the Tenants page.

* Create a tenant on the Overview page of the specified cluster.

This topic describes how to create a tenant on the Tenant Management page of the specified cluster.

This topic describes how to create a business tenant in the OceanBase cluster in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP).

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This topic takes OCP V4.0.0 as an example. The GUI varies with the OCP version. </p>

## Prerequisites

* The cluster where you want to create the tenant is the running primary cluster.

* You are logged on with an account that has the permission to manage the cluster. For example, the user is the system administrator or the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) tenant administrator.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants**.

3. In the upper-right corner of the **Tenants** page, click **Create Tenant**.

   <!-- ![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/4.deploy-the-oceanbase-database/OCP/13%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE.png) -->

   If the version of the cluster is V4.0.0 or later, you can only set the same number of units for all zones. The default value is 1.

   By default, the system displays configurable zones based on the zone information of the selected cluster. If you do not need to create a replica in a zone, click the Delete icon to delete the zone. The zone information fields that need to be configured and their descriptions are listed in the following table.

   | Field | Description |
   |---------------|---------------|
   | Replica Type | The type of the replica. Valid values:<ul><li>Full-featured Replica</li><li>Read-only Replica</li><li>Log Replica</li></ul>Select multiple full-featured replicas to ensure that they are in the majority.  |
   | Unit Specification | OCP has a set of built-in unit specifications. You can select the specification that you need from the list of unit specifications or click **Add Specification** at the bottom of the list to add a custom specification. For more information, see **OCP resource unit specifications**.  |
   | Units | You need to set the number of resource units for each zone. The number of resource units cannot exceed the number of OBServer nodes in the zone.  |
   | Zone Priority Rankings | The priorities of the zones. This priority order affects the priority order of the primary zone of the sys tenant.  The left-side list shows all zones in the cluster.  You can select one or more zones from the list box on the left to add them to the list box on the right. By default, the priority of a zone selected earlier is higher than that of a zone selected later, and the zones selected at one time have the same priority.  After you move the zones to the box on the right side, you can also drag them upward or downward to adjust their priority order. A zone takes priority over those beneath it.  |

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>If a primary zone is specified, the region where the primary zone is located must have at least two zones and at least two full-featured replicas, with one replica for each zone. </li>
    </ul>
   </main>

6. On the **Create Tenant** page, configure security settings.
