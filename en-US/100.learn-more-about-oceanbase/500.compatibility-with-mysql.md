# Compatibility with MySQL

This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database's MySQL mode and native MySQL Database.

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database is compatible with most features and statements of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0. Some features are not supported because of their limited popularity or the product architecture differences between the two databases. This topic will cover the following aspects of compatibility between OceanBase Database and MySQL Database:

* Data types

* SQL syntax

* PL features

* System views

* Character sets

* Collations

* Functions and expressions

* Partition support

* Backup and restore

* Storage engine

* Optimizer features

## Data types

OceanBase Database supports the following data types:

* Numeric data types

   * Integer types: `BOOL`/`BOOLEAN`/`TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `MEDIUMINT`, `INT`/`INTEGER`, and `BIGINT`

   * Fixed-point types: `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC`

   * Floating-point types: `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE`

   * Bit-value type: `BIT`

* Date and time types: `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, `TIME`, and `YEAR`

* Character types: `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `BINARY`, and `VARBINARY`

* Large object types: `TINYBLOB`, `BLOB`, `MEDIUMBLOB`, and `LONGBLOB`

* Text types: `TINYTEXT`, `TEXT`, `MEDIUMTEXT`, and `LONGTEXT`

* Enumeration type: `ENUM`

* Set type: `SET`

* JSON data types

* Spatial data types

## SQL syntax

:::tab
tab Supported

**SELECT**

* OceanBase Database supports most query features, including single- and multi-table queries, subqueries, inner join, semi join, outer join, grouping, aggregation, and regular data mining functions such as probability and linear regression.

* The following set operators can be used to process the results returned by multiple `SELECT` operations: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `MINUS`, `EXCEPT`, and `INTERSECT`.

* The `EXPLAIN` statement is supported for viewing execution plans.

**INSERT**

* OceanBase Database supports single- and multi-row inserts. It also supports inserting data into a specified partition.

* OceanBase Database supports the `INSERT INTO ... SELECT ...` statement.

**UPDATE**

* OceanBase Database supports single- and multi-column updates.

* OceanBase Database supports updates by using subqueries.

* OceanBase Database supports set updates.

**DELETE**

* OceanBase Database supports single- and multi-table data deletion.

**TRUNCATE**

tab Not supported

**SELECT**

* The `SELECT ... FOR SHARE ...` statement is not supported.

**TRUNCATE**

* OceanBase Database does not support truncating a table that has a transaction in progress or a table that is being locked.

## PL features

OceanBase Database is compatible with most PL features of MySQL Database, including:

* Data types
* Stored procedures
* Custom functions
* Triggers
* Exception handling

OceanBase Database also provides particular MySQL PL packages, such as `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER`, `DBMS_STATS`, `DBMS_UDR`, `DBMS_XPLAN`, and `DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY`.

For more information about PL features, see [PL reference](../700.reference/500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/100.what-is-pl/100.pl-introduction.md).

## System views

OceanBase Database implements most views of two MySQL internal databases: `information_schema` and `mysql`. However, due to the differences from MySQL Database in architecture, OceanBase Database cannot implement all views of MySQL Database or ensure consistency with MySQL Database in all column meanings of the views.

For more information about fields used in system views, see [Overview of system views](../700.reference/700.system-views/200.system-view-overview.md).

## Character sets

OceanBase Database supports the following character sets:

* binary
* utf8mb4
* gbk
* utf16
* gb18030
* latin1 
* gb18030_2022

## Collations

The following table describes the supported collations.

| Collation | Character set | Description |
|--------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| utf8mb4_general_ci | utf8mb4 | A general collation.  |
| utf8mb4_bin | utf8mb4 | A binary collation.  |
| utf8mb4_unicode_ci | utf8mb4 | A collation that is based on Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA).  |
| binary | binary | A binary collation.  |
| gbk_chinese_ci | gbk | A collation for Chinese.  |
| gbk_bin | gbk | A binary collation.  |
| utf16_general_ci | utf16 | A general collation.  |
| utf16_bin | utf16 | A binary collation.  |
| utf16_unicode_ci | utf16 | A collation that is based on UCA.  |
| gb18030_chinese_ci | gb18030 | A collation for Chinese.  |
| gb18030_bin | gb18030 | A binary collation.  |
| latin1_swedish_ci | latin1 | A collation for Swedish/Finnish.  |
| latin1_bin | latin1 | A binary collation.  |
| gb18030_2022_bin | gb18030_2022 | A binary collation.  |
| gb18030_2022_chinese_ci | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by Pinyin. The collation is case-insensitive. This is the default collation for this character set in MySQL mode.  |
| gb18030_2022_chinese_cs | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by Pinyin. The collation is case-sensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_radical_ci | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by radicals. The collation is case-insensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_radical_cs | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by radicals. The collation is case-sensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_stroke_ci | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by strokes. The collation is case-insensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_stroke_cs | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by strokes. The collation is case-sensitive.  |

## Functions

:::tab
tab Supported

* The analytic (window) functions supported by OceanBase Database are a superset of those supported by MySQL Database. This means that OceanBase Database supports all analytic (window) functions supported by MySQL Database.

tab Not supported

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database does not support the following functions:

* String functions: `LOAD_FILE()` and `MATCH()`.

* XML functions: `EXTRACTVALUE` and `UPDATEXML`.

* Locking functions: `GET_LOCK()`, `IS_FREE_LOCK()`, `IS_USED_LOCK()`, `RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS()`, and `RELEASE_LOCK()`.

* Other function: `MASTER_POS_WAIT()`.

:::

## Partition support

The partition support feature of OceanBase Database is different from that of MySQL Database.

* OceanBase Database supports partitioning, template-based subpartitioning, and non-template-based subpartitioning. MySQL Database does not support non-template-based subpartitioning.

* OceanBase Database supports the following subpartitioning methods: HASH, KEY, RANGE, RANGE COLUMNS, LIST, and LIST COLUMNS. MySQL Database supports only HASH and KEY subpartitioning.

For more information about partitions, see [Partition overview](../700.reference/300.database-object-management/100.manage-object-of-mysql-mode/300.manage-partitions-of-mysql-mode/100.partition-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

tab Supported

* Commands to query execution plans:

   * Only the `ID`, `OPERATOR`, `NAME`, `EST. ROWS`, and `COST` columns and the operator details are exported.

* Statistics query:

   * The optimizer allows you to manually query the histogram statistics information about column values in the data dictionary table by using the `ANALYZE TABLE` statement.

   * The optimizer automatically displays views of the table statistics and column statistics.

   * Outer join optimization

   * Outer join simplification

   * Block Nested-Loop (BNL) and Batched Key Access (BKA) joins

   * Conditional filtering

   * `ORDER BY` optimization

   * `GROUP BY` optimization

   * Elimination by using `DISTINCT`

   * `LIMIT` pushdown

   * Window function optimization

   * Avoiding full table scan

   * Predicate pushdown
