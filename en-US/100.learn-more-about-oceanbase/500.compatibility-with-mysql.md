# Compatibility with MySQL

This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database's MySQL mode and native MySQL Database.

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database is compatible with most features and statements of MySQL 5.7 and 8.0. Some features are not supported because of their limited popularity or the product architecture differences between the two databases. This topic will cover the following aspects of compatibility between OceanBase Database and MySQL Database:

* Data types

* SQL syntax

* PL features

* System views

* Character sets

* Collations

* Functions and expressions

* Partition support

* Backup and restore

* Storage engine

* Optimizer

OceanBase Database supports the following data types:

* Numeric data types

   * Integer types: `BOOL`/`BOOLEAN`/`TINYINT`, `SMALLINT`, `MEDIUMINT`, `INT`/`INTEGER`, and `BIGINT`

   * Fixed-point types: `DECIMAL` and `NUMERIC`

   * Floating-point types: `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE`

   * Bit-value type: `BIT`

* Date and time types: `DATETIME`, `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`, `TIME`, and `YEAR`

* Character types: `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `BINARY`, and `VARBINARY`

## PL features

OceanBase Database is compatible with most PL features of MySQL Database, including:

* Data types
* Stored procedures
* Custom functions
* Triggers
* Exception handling

OceanBase Database also provides particular MySQL PL packages, such as `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER`, `DBMS_STATS`, `DBMS_UDR`, `DBMS_XPLAN`, and `DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY`.

For more information about PL features, see [PL reference](../700.reference/500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/100.what-is-pl/100.pl-introduction.md).

## System views

OceanBase Database implements most views of two MySQL internal databases: `information_schema` and `mysql`. However, due to the differences from MySQL Database in architecture, OceanBase Database cannot implement all views of MySQL Database or ensure consistency with MySQL Database in all column meanings of the views.

For more information about system views, see [Overview of system views](../700.reference/700.system-views/200.system-view-overview.md).

## Character sets

OceanBase Database supports the following character sets:

* binary
* utf8mb4
* gbk
* utf16
* gb18030
* latin1
* gb18030_2022

## Collations

The following table describes the supported collations.

| Collation | Character set | Description |
|--------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------|
| utf8mb4_general_ci | utf8mb4 | A general collation.  |
| utf8mb4_bin | utf8mb4 | A binary collation.  |
| utf8mb4_unicode_ci | utf8mb4 | A collation that is based on Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA).  |
| binary | binary | A binary collation.  |
| gbk_chinese_ci | gbk | A collation for Chinese.  |
| gbk_bin | gbk | A binary collation.  |
| utf16_general_ci | utf16 | A general collation.  |
| utf16_bin | utf16 | A binary collation.  |
| utf16_unicode_ci | utf16 | A collation that is based on UCA.  |
| gb18030_chinese_ci | gb18030 | A collation for Chinese.  |
| gb18030_bin | gb18030 | A binary collation.  |
| latin1_swedish_ci | latin1 | A collation for Swedish/Finnish.  |
| latin1_bin | latin1 | A binary collation.  |
| gb18030_2022_bin | gb18030_2022 | A binary collation.  |
| gb18030_2022_chinese_ci | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by Pinyin. The collation is case-insensitive. This is the default collation for this character set in MySQL mode.  |
| gb18030_2022_chinese_cs | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by Pinyin. The collation is case-sensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_radical_ci | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by radicals. The collation is case-insensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_radical_cs | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by radicals. The collation is case-sensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_stroke_ci | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by strokes. The collation is case-insensitive.  |
| gb18030_2022_stroke_cs | gb18030_2022 | A collation that sorts data by strokes. The collation is case-sensitive.  |

## Functions

:::tab
tab Supported

The analytic (window) functions supported by OceanBase Database are a superset of those supported by MySQL Database. This means that OceanBase Database supports all analytic (window) functions supported by MySQL Database.

tab Not supported

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database does not support the following functions:

* String functions: `LOAD_FILE()` and `MATCH()`

* XML functions: `ExtractValue()` and `UpdateXML()`

* Locking functions: `GET_LOCK()`, `IS_FREE_LOCK()`, `IS_USED_LOCK()`, `RELEASE_ALL_LOCKS()`, and `RELEASE_LOCK()`

* Other functions: `MASTER_POS_WAIT()`

:::

## Partition support

The partition support feature of OceanBase Database is different from that of MySQL Database.

* OceanBase Database supports partitioning, template-based subpartitioning, and non-template-based subpartitioning. MySQL Database does not support non-template-based subpartitioning.

* OceanBase Database supports the following subpartitioning methods: HASH, KEY, RANGE, RANGE COLUMNS, LIST, and LIST COLUMNS. MySQL Database supports only HASH and KEY subpartitioning.

For more information about partitions, see [Partition overview](../700.reference/300.database-object-management/100.manage-object-of-mysql-mode/300.manage-partitions-of-mysql-mode/100.partition-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).
