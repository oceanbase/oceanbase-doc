# Overview

This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database's Oracle mode and native Oracle Database.

OceanBase Database is compatible with Oracle Database in terms of basic features, including the data types, SQL features, and database objects. OceanBase Database is compatible with most PL-related R&D features of Oracle Database. In terms of advanced features such as database security, backup and restore, high availability, and optimizer, OceanBase Database provides sound compatibility with and even outperforms Oracle Database. Therefore, you can smoothly migrate data and services from Oracle Database to OceanBase Database without spending much time learning everything about OceanBase Database.

However, due to the differences in the underlying architecture and product form between the two, OceanBase Database does not support some features of Oracle Database and differs from it in some aspects. This topic describes the compatibility between OceanBase Database and Oracle Database in the following aspects:

* SQL data types

* Built-in functions

* SQL syntax

* PL features

* System views

* Character sets

* Collations

* Database object management

* Security features

* Backup and restore

* SQL engine

## SQL data types

OceanBase Database is compatible with most of the data types supported by Oracle Database. For more information, see [SQL data types](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/200.sql-data-type.md).

However, for optimization reasons, the `LONG` and `LONG RAW` data types are considered too outdated, and OceanBase Database currently has no plans to support these two data types.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>OceanBase Database supports large object (LOB) data types sized no more than 48 MB. Due to the poor performance of LOB data types, we recommend that you do not use them in complex scenarios. For more information, see <a href="../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/300.basic-elements-of-oracle-mode/100.built-in-data-types-of-oracle-mode/600.large-object-data-type-of-oracle-mode/100.data-types-of-large-objects-of-oracle-mode.md">Overview of LOB data types</a>. </p>
</main>

## Built-in functions

OceanBase Database is compatible with most of the built-in functions supported by Oracle Database. For more information, see [Built-in functions](../400.compatibility-with-oracle/300.built-in-functions.md).

## SQL syntax

OceanBase Database supports most of the SQL syntax in Oracle Database. For some unsupported SQL syntaxes, OceanBase Database will return an "unsupported syntax" error to indicate that the corresponding features are unavailable.
