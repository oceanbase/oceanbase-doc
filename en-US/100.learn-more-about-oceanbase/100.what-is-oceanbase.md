# Overview

OceanBase Database is an enterprise-level, native distributed database independently developed by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware. Its groundbreaking deployment mode of "five IDCs across three regions" sets a new standard for automatic, lossless disaster recovery at the region level. OceanBase Database has also set new records in the TPC-C benchmark test, supporting more than 1,500 nodes in one cluster. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL.

## Core features

### High availability

OceanBase Database implements a unique disaster recovery solution with five IDCs across three regions, which sets forth a new standard for lossless disaster recovery in the financial industry. OceanBase Database supports multi-active IDCs deployed across multiple regions for zone- and geo-disaster recovery, which meets the Level 6 disaster recovery requirements of the financial industry with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 0 and a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 8 seconds.

### High compatibility

OceanBase Database is highly compatible with most general features of Oracle and MySQL, and supports advanced features such as procedural language and triggers. OceanBase Migration Service (OMS), an automatic migration tool, is provided to support migration assessment and reverse synchronization to ensure data migration security when a core system is migrated to OceanBase Database in key industries such as finance, public governance, and communication service.

### Scaling out

OceanBase Database supports rapid transparent horizontal scaling in response to business fluctuations, and achieves high performance based on a quasi-memory transaction processing architecture. You can deploy thousands of nodes in an OceanBase cluster, where the maximum data volume can exceed 3 PB and a single table can contain trillions of rows.

### Low costs

OceanBase Database adopts a storage engine based on the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree), which can achieve a high compression ratio and reduce storage costs by 70% to 90%. OceanBase Database also supports the multi-tenant architecture, which means that the same cluster can serve multiple business lines with the data of one tenant isolated from that of others. These features reduce deployment and O&M costs.

### Real-time HTAP

OceanBase Database uses the same database engine to perform online real-time transactions and real-time analysis on the same set of data. Multiple replicas of the same set of data can be stored in different forms for different purposes. This fundamentally ensures data consistency.

### Security and reliability

The OceanBase team has been independently developing OceanBase Database since 2010 and has full control over its source code. The integrated architecture of OceanBase Database has reliably supported large-scale financial core systems for many years. In addition to a comprehensive role and permission management system, OceanBase Database also provides transparent encryption of data for storage and communication, supports ShangMi (SM) encryption algorithms, and is certified to meet the standards of Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS) Level 3.
