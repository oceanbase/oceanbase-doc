# Overview

OceanBase Database is a native, enterprise-level distributed database developed independently by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware and introduces a new city-level disaster recovery standard known as "Five IDCs across Three Regions". As the world's first distributed database to pass the TPC-C benchmark test, it can support over 1,500 nodes in a single cluster. Additionally, it features cloud-native architecture, strong consistency, and high compatibility with other popular databases such as Oracle and MySQL.
## Core features

### High availability

OceanBase Database implements a unique disaster recovery solution with five IDCs across three regions, which sets forth a new standard for lossless disaster recovery in the financial industry. OceanBase Database supports multi-active IDCs deployed across multiple regions for zone- and geo-disaster recovery, which meets the Level 6 disaster recovery requirements of the financial industry with a recovery point objective (RPO) of 0 and a recovery time objective (RTO) of less than 8 seconds.

### High compatibility

OceanBase Database is highly compatible with most general features of Oracle and MySQL, and supports advanced features such as procedural language and triggers. OceanBase Migration Service (OMS), an automatic migration tool, is provided to support migration assessment and reverse synchronization to ensure data migration security when a core system is migrated to OceanBase Database in key industries such as finance, public governance, and communication service.

### Scaling out

OceanBase Database supports rapid transparent horizontal scaling in response to business fluctuations, and achieves high performance based on a quasi-memory transaction processing architecture. You can deploy thousands of nodes in an OceanBase cluster, where the maximum data volume can exceed 3 PB and a single table can contain trillions of rows.

### Low costs

OceanBase Database adopts a storage engine based on the log-structured merge-tree (LSM-tree), which can achieve a high compression ratio and reduce storage costs by 70% to 90%. OceanBase Database also supports the multi-tenant architecture, which means that the same cluster can serve multiple business lines with the data of one tenant isolated from that of others. These features reduce deployment and O&M costs.

### Real-time HTAP

OceanBase Database uses the same database engine to perform online real-time transactions and real-time analysis on the same set of data. Multiple replicas of the same set of data can be stored in different forms for different purposes. This fundamentally ensures data consistency.

### Security and reliability

The OceanBase team has been independently developing OceanBase Database for 12 years and has full control over its source code. The integrated architecture of OceanBase Database has reliably supported large-scale financial core systems for nine years. In addition to a comprehensive roles and permissions management system, OceanBase Database also provides transparent encryption of data for storage and communication, supports ShangMi (SM) encryption algorithms, and meets the Level 3 requirements of Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS).
