# Single-table queries

This topic describes how to use SQL statements to perform single-table queries on tables in OceanBase Database.

## Prerequisites

* You have connected to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database.
* You have the `SELECT` privilege. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the required privileges, contact the administrator to obtain the privileges. For more information, see [Grant direct privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/200.authority-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Syntax

You can use the [SELECT](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/8100.select-of-mysql-mode/100.select-of-mysql-mode.md) statement to query data.

The general structure of a single-table query using the `SELECT` statement is as follows:

```sql
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT | UNIQUE | SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS] select_list
FROM table_name
[ WHERE query_condition ]
[ GROUP BY group_by_condition ]
[ HAVING group_condition ]
[ ORDER BY column_list ][ASC | DESC]
[ LIMIT limit_clause ]

column_list:
 column_name[,column_name...]
```

**The parameters are described as follows:**

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| select_list                 | The list of columns to be retrieved, including column names, expressions, and aggregate functions. Multiple columns can be separated by commas.|
| table_name                  | The name of the table from which to retrieve data.|
| WHERE query_condition       | (Optional) Specifies the retrieve condition. Only rows that meet the condition will be returned.|
| GROUP BY group_by_condition | (Optional) Groups the results by the specified column. This parameter is typically used with aggregate functions.|
| HAVING group_condition      | (Optional) Filters the grouped result set. Only groups that meet the condition are returned.|
| ORDER BY column_list        | (Optional) Sorts the result set. You can specify one or multiple columns for sorting.|
| ASC \| DESC                  | (Optional) Specifies the order of sorting. ASC indicates ascending order (default), and DESC indicates descending order.|
| LIMIT limit_clause          | (Optional) Limits the number of rows returned in the result set.|
| column_list                 | Specifies the columns to be retrieved. The value of this parameter can be a single column or multiple columns separated by commas.|
| column_name                 | The name of the column to be retrieved.|

### Execution order of keywords in the SELECT statement

If you use the `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` keywords in a query, these clauses are executed in the following sequence:

1. The `FROM` clause is executed to find the required table.

2. The `WHERE` clause is executed to specify conditions.

3. The `GROUP BY` clause is executed to group or aggregate records. If `GROUP BY` is not executed, all records are considered a group.

4. The `HAVING` clause is executed to filter the grouped results.

5. The `SELECT` clause is executed.

6. The `DISTINCT` clause is executed to remove duplicate rows.

7. The `ORDER BY` clause is executed to sort the results in ascending or descending order.

8. Execute `LIMIT` to limit the number of records.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>The difference between <code>WHERE</code> and <code>HAVING</code> is that <code>WHERE</code> filters data before grouping or aggregation, while <code>HAVING</code> filters data after grouping and returns the entire query results. </p>
</main>

## Create a test table and add test data to the table

1. Create a table named `student`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE student (
     id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
     name VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
     gender TINYINT NOT NULL,
     age INT NOT NULL,
     score FLOAT NOT NULL,
     enrollment_date DATE NOT NULL,
     notes VARCHAR(50)
   );
   ```

2. Insert 10 records into the `student` table.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO student (name, gender, age, score, enrollment_date, notes)
     VALUES ('Emma', 0, 20, 85.0, '2021-09-01',NULL),
     ('William', 1, 21, 90.5, '2021-09-02','B'),
     ('Olivia', 0, 19, 95.5, '2021-09-03','A'),
     ('James', 1, 20, 87.5, '2021-09-03',NULL),
     ('Sophia', 0, 20, 91.5, '2021-09-05','B'),
     ('Benjamin', 1, 21, 96.5, '2021-09-01','A'),
     ('Ava', 0, 22, 89.5, '2021-09-06',NULL),
     ('Michael', 1, 18, 93.5, '2021-09-08','B'),
     ('Charlotte', 1, 19, 88.0, '2021-09-06',NULL),
     ('Ethan', 1, 20, 92.0, '2021-09-01','B');
   ```

3. Create a table named `fruit_order`.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE fruit_order(
     order_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Order ID',
     user_id BIGINT NOT NULL COMMENT 'Customer ID',
     user_name VARCHAR(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT '' COMMENT 'Customer name',
     fruit_price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 COMMENT 'Order amount',
     order_year SMALLINT NOT NULL COMMENT 'Year of order placement'
   ) COMMENT 'Order table';
   ```

4. Insert 10 records into the `fruit_order` table.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO fruit_order(user_id, user_name,fruit_price,order_year)
     VALUES (1011,'A1',13.11,'2019'),
     (1011,'A1',22.21,'2020'),
     (1011,'A1',58.83,'2020'),
     (1022,'B2',23.34,'2019'),
     (1022,'B2',12.22,'2019'),
     (1022,'B2',14.66,'2021'),
     (1022,'B2',34.44,'2021'),
     (1033,'C3',51.55,'2020'),
     (1033,'C3',63.66,'2021'),
     (1034,'D4',53.62,'2021');
   ```

## Basic queries

When you use `SELECT`, we recommend that you use meaningful column aliases and properly organize the columns to improve the readability and organization of the result set, making it easier to understand the query results.

### Query all columns

* You can execute the `SELECT * FROM student;` statement to query all student information.

* You can also execute the `SELECT id,name,gender,age,score,enrollment_date FROM student;` statement to query all student information.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Although you can use an asterisk (<code>*</code>) to quickly list all fields, manually listing all fields in the statement improves query performance and code readability and maintainability. </p>
</main>

Example 1: Query the data of all rows in the `student` table.

```sql
SELECT id, name, gender, age, score, enrollment_date, notes
FROM student;
```

or

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+-------+
| id | name      | gender | age | score | enrollment_date | notes |
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |      0 |  20 |    85 | 2021-09-01      | NULL  |
|  2 | William   |      1 |  21 |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      | B     |
|  3 | Olivia    |      0 |  19 |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      | A     |
|  4 | James     |      1 |  20 |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      | NULL  |
|  5 | Sophia    |      0 |  20 |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      | B     |
|  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |  21 |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      | A     |
|  7 | Ava       |      0 |  22 |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      | NULL  |
|  8 | Michael   |      1 |  18 |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      | B     |
|  9 | Charlotte |      1 |  19 |    88 | 2021-09-06      | NULL  |
| 10 | Ethan     |      1 |  20 |    92 | 2021-09-01      | B     |
+----+-----------+--------+-----+-------+-----------------+-------+
10 rows in set
```

### Query specified columns

You can query data in specified columns based on column names.

Example 2: Query the data of all rows in the `student` table and return the data of the `id` and `name` columns in each row.

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+
| id | name      |
+----+-----------+
|  1 | Emma      |
|  2 | William   |
|  3 | Olivia    |
|  4 | James     |
|  5 | Sophia    |
|  6 | Benjamin  |
|  7 | Ava       |
|  8 | Michael   |
|  9 | Charlotte |
| 10 | Ethan     |
+----+-----------+
10 rows in set
```

### Query calculated values and specify column aliases

You can calculate the data of specified columns in a query.

Example 3: Select data from the `id`, `name`, `age`, and `age+5` columns of the `student` table, and specify the alias `age_plus_5` for the `age+5` column that stores the result of calculation.

```sql
SELECT id, name, age, age+5 AS age_plus_5
FROM student;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-----+------------+
| id | name      | age | age_plus_5 |
+----+-----------+-----+------------+
|  1 | Emma      |  20 |         25 |
|  2 | William   |  21 |         26 |
|  3 | Olivia    |  19 |         24 |
|  4 | James     |  20 |         25 |
|  5 | Sophia    |  20 |         25 |
|  6 | Benjamin  |  21 |         26 |
|  7 | Ava       |  22 |         27 |
|  8 | Michael   |  18 |         23 |
|  9 | Charlotte |  19 |         24 |
| 10 | Ethan     |  20 |         25 |
+----+-----------+-----+------------+
10 rows in set
```

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>For more information about how to use operators and functions to process data of specified columns in a query, see <b>Use operators and functions in queries</b>. </p>
</main>

## Data filtering

You can add a `WHERE` clause to the `SELECT` statement to query data that meets specified conditions. The `WHERE` clause can contain one or more conditions for filtering data. Only data that meets the `WHERE` conditions will be returned. You can flexibly use query conditions based on specific requirements to filter and retrieve target data.

When you use the `WHERE` clause, make sure that the conditions are correct and appropriate operators are used.

The following table lists commonly used query conditions specified by the `WHERE` clause.

| Query condition type | Predicate |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Comparison query | `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`, and `<>` |
| Logical query (multiple conditions supported in a query) | `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` |
| Fuzzy query (matching by characters) | `LIKE` and `NOT LIKE` |
| Interval query (with a specified range) | `BETWEEN AND` and `NOT BETWEEN AND` |
| Query with a specified set | `IN` and `NOT IN` |
| NULL value query | `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` |

For more information about operators in query conditions, see [Comparison operators](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/200.operator-of-mysql-mode/500.comparison-operators-of-mysql-mode.md).

### Queries with comparison operators

#### Equal to (`=`)

This operator queries data from the specified column that is equal to the target value. If the value is of string type, it needs to be enclosed in single or double quotes. 
  
Example 4: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are equal to `1`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `gender` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, gender
FROM student
WHERE gender = 1;    
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+--------+
| id | name      | gender |
+----+-----------+--------+
|  2 | William   |      1 |
|  4 | James     |      1 |
|  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |
|  8 | Michael   |      1 |
|  9 | Charlotte |      1 |
| 10 | Ethan     |      1 |
+----+-----------+--------+
6 rows in set
```

#### Not equal to (`<>` and `!=`)

This operator includes two different expressions: `<>` and `!=`.

Example 5: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are not equal to `1`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `gender` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, gender
FROM student
WHERE gender <> 1;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+--------+--------+
| id | name   | gender |
+----+--------+--------+
|  1 | Emma   |      0 |
|  3 | Olivia |      0 |
|  5 | Sophia |      0 |
|  7 | Ava    |      0 |
+----+--------+--------+
4 rows in set
```

#### Greater than (`>`) and less than (`<`)

The greater than operator (`>`) and the less than operator (`<`) compare numbers based on their values. If characters are compared, they are converted into their respective ASCII codes, and then the ASCII codes are compared from left to right.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>The greater than or equal to (>=) and less than or equal to (<=) operators operate in a similar manner.  </p>
</main>

Example 6: Query all rows in the `student` table where `score` values are less than `90`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score
FROM student
WHERE score < 90;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+
| id | name      | score |
+----+-----------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |    85 |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
+----+-----------+-------+
4 rows in set
```

### Queries with logical conditions

Logical query operators `AND` and `OR` support queries with multiple conditions.

#### `AND`

The `AND` keyword is used to combine multiple conditions, ensuring that only the data satisfying all conditions will be returned.
  
Example 7: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are equal to `1` and `score` values are less than or equal to `90`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `gender`, and `score` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, gender, score
FROM student
WHERE gender = 1 AND score <= 90;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+--------+-------+
| id | name      | gender | score |
+----+-----------+--------+-------+
|  4 | James     |      1 |  87.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |      1 |    88 |
+----+-----------+--------+-------+
2 rows in set
```

#### `OR`

The `OR` keyword is used to link multiple conditions, returning data that satisfies any of the conditions.

Example 8: Query all rows in the `student` table where `gender` values are equal to `1` or `score` values are less than `90`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `gender`, and `score` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, gender, score
FROM student
WHERE gender = 1 OR score < 90;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+--------+-------+
| id | name      | gender | score |
+----+-----------+--------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |      0 |    85 |
|  2 | William   |      1 |  90.5 |
|  4 | James     |      1 |  87.5 |
|  6 | Benjamin  |      1 |  96.5 |
|  7 | Ava       |      0 |  89.5 |
|  8 | Michael   |      1 |  93.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |      1 |    88 |
| 10 | Ethan     |      1 |    92 |
+----+-----------+--------+-------+
8 rows in set
```

### Fuzzy queries (LIKE)

The predicate `LIKE` can be used for string matching.

The syntax means finding data that matches the corresponding column value with the `pattern`. The `pattern` can be a complete string or contain wildcards `%` and `_`, where:

* The underscore (`_`) exactly matches any character in the value.

* The percent sign (`%`) matches zero or multiple characters in the value. The pattern `%` cannot match `NULL`.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>If the database character set uses ASCII, one Chinese character requires two underscores (<code>_</code>); if the database character set uses GBK, one Chinese character requires only one underscore (<code>_</code>). </p>
</main>

Example 9: Query all rows in the `student` table where `name` values contain `am`, and return the data from the `id` and `name` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
WHERE name LIKE '%am%';
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
|  2 | William  |
|  4 | James    |
|  6 | Benjamin |
+----+----------+
3 rows in set
```

### Range queries (BETWEEN AND)

The `BETWEEN AND` operator selects data between two values. These values can be numerals, literals, or dates.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>Do not swap the two boundary values of a range query. The left boundary value should be greater than or equal to the starting point, and the right boundary value should be less than or equal to the ending point.</p>
</main>

Example 10: Query all rows in the `student` table where `score` values range from 85 to 90, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, and `score` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score
FROM student
WHERE score BETWEEN 85 AND 90;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+
| id | name      | score |
+----+-----------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |    85 |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
+----+-----------+-------+
4 rows in set
```

### Queries with a specified set (IN)

The `IN` operator is used to specify multiple values as a set in a `WHERE` clause. It returns data from the specified column that matches any value in the set. On the other hand, the `NOT IN` operator returns data from the specified column that does not match any value in the set.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The value in the <code>[NOT] IN</code> set must be of the same type or compatible with each other. </li>
    <li>The values in the <code>[NOT] IN</code> set do not support wildcards. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

Example 11: Query all rows in the `student` table where `id` values belong to the set of `(1, 3, 5, 7)`, and return the data from the `id` and `name` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
WHERE id IN (1,3,5,7);
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+--------+
| id | name   |
+----+--------+
|  1 | Emma   |
|  3 | Olivia |
|  5 | Sophia |
|  7 | Ava    |
+----+--------+
4 rows in set
```

### NULL value queries

Due to the inaccurate results obtained when using comparison operators, `LIKE`, `BETWEEN AND`, `IN`, and `NOT IN` to query for `NULL` values, we recommend that you use the dedicated query statements `IS NULL` and `IS NOT NULL` for `NULL` value queries. Additionally, the safe equal operator (`<=>`) can be used to compare both normal values and `NULL` values.

#### `IS NULL`

The `IS NULL` condition is used to query the data where the specified column's value is `NULL`.

Example 12: Query all rows in the `student` table where `notes` is NULL, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `score`, and `notes` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score, notes
FROM student
WHERE notes IS NULL;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+-------+
| id | name      | score | notes |
+----+-----------+-------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |    85 | NULL  |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 | NULL  |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 | NULL  |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 | NULL  |
+----+-----------+-------+-------+
4 rows in set
```

#### `IS NOT NULL`

The `IS NOT NULL` condition is used to query the data where the specified column's value is not `NULL`.

Example 13: Query all rows in the `student` table where the `notes` is not `NULL`, and return the data from the `id`, `name`, `score`, and `notes` columns in these rows.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score, notes
FROM student
WHERE notes IS NOT NULL;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+-------+-------+
| id | name     | score | notes |
+----+----------+-------+-------+
|  2 | William  |  90.5 | B     |
|  3 | Olivia   |  95.5 | A     |
|  5 | Sophia   |  91.5 | B     |
|  6 | Benjamin |  96.5 | A     |
|  8 | Michael  |  93.5 | B     |
| 10 | Ethan    |    92 | B     |
+----+----------+-------+-------+
6 rows in set
```

## `GROUP BY` queries

In SQL queries, the `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the query results. `GROUP BY` supports grouping by a single field or multiple fields. Before you perform data grouping, you can filter the data using the `WHERE` clause and then filter the data using the `HAVING` clause. You can also use the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the data after grouping.

**Considerations:**

* When you use the `GROUP BY` clause, make sure that the columns in the `SELECT` statement are either included in the `GROUP BY` clause or used as aggregate functions.

* When you use the `HAVING` clause, make sure that the conditions are applied to the grouped results, not the original data.

### `GROUP BY` query based on a single field

Example 14: Query the number of orders placed by each customer in the `fruit_order` table, and return the data of the `user_id` and `COUNT(order_id)` columns.

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id)
FROM fruit_order
GROUP BY user_id
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+-----------------+
| user_id | COUNT(order_id) |
+---------+-----------------+
|    1011 |               3 |
|    1022 |               4 |
|    1033 |               2 |
|    1034 |               1 |
+---------+-----------------+
4 rows in set
```

### `GROUP BY` query based on multiple fields

Example 15: Query the number of orders placed by each customer each year in the `fruit_order` table, and return the data of the `user_id`, `order_year`, and `COUNT(order_id)` columns.

```sql
SELECT user_id, order_year, COUNT(order_id)
FROM fruit_order
GROUP BY user_id,order_year;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+------------+-----------------+
| user_id | order_year | COUNT(order_id) |
+---------+------------+-----------------+
|    1011 |       2019 |               1 |
|    1011 |       2020 |               2 |
|    1022 |       2019 |               2 |
|    1022 |       2021 |               2 |
|    1033 |       2020 |               1 |
|    1033 |       2021 |               1 |
|    1034 |       2021 |               1 |
+---------+------------+-----------------+
7 rows in set
```

### Filter data before grouping

Example 16: Query the number of orders placed by each customer in 2020, and return the data of the `user_id` and `COUNT(order_id)` columns.

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id)
FROM fruit_order t
WHERE t.order_year = 2020
GROUP BY user_id
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+-----------------+
| user_id | COUNT(order_id) |
+---------+-----------------+
|    1011 |               2 |
|    1033 |               1 |
+---------+-----------------+
2 rows in set
```

### Filter data after grouping

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>When a <code>GROUP BY</code> query includes the <code>HAVING</code> clause, it first obtains the SQL query results without the <code>HAVING</code> clause, then uses the <code>HAVING</code> condition to filter the data based on these results, and finally returns the filtered data. Therefore, after <code>HAVING</code>, you can use aggregate functions, and these aggregate functions do not have to be the same as the aggregate functions after <code>SELECT</code>. </p>
</main>

Example 17: Query customers who placed two or more orders in 2019 and return the data of `user_id` and `COUNT(order_id)`.

```sql
SELECT user_id, COUNT(order_id)
FROM fruit_order t
WHERE t.order_year = 2019
GROUP BY user_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) >= 2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+-----------------+
| user_id | COUNT(order_id) |
+---------+-----------------+
|    1022 |               2 |
+---------+-----------------+
1 row in set
```

### Sort data after grouping

Example 18: Query the maximum order amount of each customer and return the data of `user_id` and `MAX(fruit_price)` sorted by maximum order amount in descending order.

```sql
SELECT user_id, MAX(fruit_price)
FROM fruit_order t
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY MAX(fruit_price) DESC;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+---------+------------------+
| user_id | MAX(fruit_price) |
+---------+------------------+
|    1033 |            63.66 |
|    1011 |            58.83 |
|    1034 |            53.62 |
|    1022 |            34.44 |
+---------+------------------+
4 rows in set
```

### Aggregate queries

An aggregate query is a method used to perform aggregation operations on data and return summary results. It can be used to perform statistical operations such as counting, summing, averaging, finding the maximum and minimum values, and other aggregation operations on a set of data. Aggregate queries are typically used with the `GROUP BY` clause to group data and perform aggregation operations on each group. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the data based on specified columns, and then aggregate functions are applied to each group, generating a result set.

The following table lists frequently-used aggregate functions in `GROUP BY` queries.

| Aggregate function | Description |
|---------|--------------|
| MAX() | Queries the maximum value of the specified column.  |
| MIN() | Queries the minimum value of the specified column.  |
| COUNT() | Returns the number of rows in the query result.  |
| SUM() | Returns the sum of the specified column.  |
| AVG() | Returns the average value of the data in the specified column.  |

For more information about aggregate queries, see [Use aggregate functions in queries](300.use-operators-and-functions-in-query-of-mysql-mode/700.use-aggregate-functions-in-queries-of-mysql-mode.md).


## Data sorting

Data sorting is an operation that arranges the query results based on specified columns or expressions, allowing data to be rearranged in either ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. In SQL queries, the `ORDER BY` clause is used to specify the sorting method. The `ORDER BY` clause supports sorting by a single field, sorting by multiple fields, sorting by aliases, and sorting by functions, with multiple fields separated by commas. When performing a sorting query, if the `ASC` or `DESC` keywords are not added, the default query result is sorted in ascending order.

Using the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the result set is a resource-intensive operation, especially for large datasets. When necessary, we recommend that you use indexes to optimize the sorting operation. Ensure that the correct columns and sorting order are specified.

### Sorting by single field

Example 19: Query student information in the `student` table, and return the information sorted by `score` in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score
FROM student
ORDER BY score;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+
| id | name      | score |
+----+-----------+-------+
|  1 | Emma      |    85 |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
|  2 | William   |  90.5 |
|  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |
| 10 | Ethan     |    92 |
|  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |
|  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |
|  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |
+----+-----------+-------+
10 rows in set
```

Example 20: Query student information in the `student` table and return the information sorted by `score` in descending order.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score
FROM student
ORDER BY score DESC;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+
| id | name      | score |
+----+-----------+-------+
|  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |
|  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |
|  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |
| 10 | Ethan     |    92 |
|  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |
|  2 | William   |  90.5 |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 |
|  1 | Emma      |    85 |
+----+-----------+-------+
10 rows in set
```

### Sorting by multiple fields

Example 21: Query student information in the `student` table, and return the information sorted by `enrollment_date` in descending order and by `score` in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score, enrollment_date
FROM student
ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC,score ASC;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
| id | name      | score | enrollment_date |
+----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
|  8 | Michael   |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 | 2021-09-06      |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      |
|  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  2 | William   |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      |
|  1 | Emma      |    85 | 2021-09-01      |
| 10 | Ethan     |    92 | 2021-09-01      |
|  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      |
+----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
10 rows in set
```

### Sorting by functions

You can use functions in the `ORDER BY` clause to sort query results. These functions can be applied to specified columns or expressions to support complex data sorting.

Example 22: Query student information in the `student` table, and return the information sorted by `DAY(enrollment_date)` in descending order and by `score` in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score, enrollment_date
FROM student
ORDER BY DAY(enrollment_date) DESC,score ASC;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
| id | name      | score | enrollment_date |
+----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
|  8 | Michael   |  93.5 | 2021-09-08      |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 | 2021-09-06      |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 | 2021-09-06      |
|  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 | 2021-09-05      |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 | 2021-09-03      |
|  2 | William   |  90.5 | 2021-09-02      |
|  1 | Emma      |    85 | 2021-09-01      |
| 10 | Ethan     |    92 | 2021-09-01      |
|  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 | 2021-09-01      |
+----+-----------+-------+-----------------+
10 rows in set
```

### Sorting after data filtering

You can use the `WHERE` clause to filter data before sorting.

Example 23: Query information about students whose `score` values are greater than `85` in the `student` table, and return the information sorted by `DAY(enrollment_date)` in ascending order.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score, DAY(enrollment_date)
FROM student
WHERE score > 85
ORDER BY DAY(enrollment_date) ASC;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+-----------+-------+----------------------+
| id | name      | score | DAY(enrollment_date) |
+----+-----------+-------+----------------------+
|  6 | Benjamin  |  96.5 |                    1 |
| 10 | Ethan     |    92 |                    1 |
|  2 | William   |  90.5 |                    2 |
|  3 | Olivia    |  95.5 |                    3 |
|  4 | James     |  87.5 |                    3 |
|  5 | Sophia    |  91.5 |                    5 |
|  7 | Ava       |  89.5 |                    6 |
|  9 | Charlotte |    88 |                    6 |
|  8 | Michael   |  93.5 |                    8 |
+----+-----------+-------+----------------------+
9 rows in set
```

## LIMIT clause

### Limit the number of rows in the result set

In SQL queries, the `LIMIT` clause can be used to limit the number of rows returned in the result set.

The format of the `LIMIT` clause to limit the number of rows is as follows:

```sql
LIMIT [offset,] row_count
```

or

```sql
LIMIT row_count OFFSET offset
```

where

* `offset` specifies the number of rows to skip. The value range is  \[0,+∞). In the first format, `offset` is optional and its default value is 0, indicating that zero rows are skipped.

* `row_count` specifies the number of rows to be returned. The value range is [0, +∞). In the first format, if `offset` is not specified, data is returned from the first row by default.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>The values of <code>offset</code> and <code>row_count</code> are subject to the following constraints:<ul><li>Expressions cannot be used.</li><li>Only explicit numerical values are allowed, and they cannot be negative.</li></ul></p>
</main>

#### Retrieve the first m rows of records

Example 24: Retrieve the first five rows of the `student` table, and return the data of the `id` and `name` columns.

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
LIMIT 5;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
|  1 | Emma    |
|  2 | William |
|  3 | Olivia  |
|  4 | James   |
|  5 | Sophia  |
+----+---------+
5 rows in set
```

#### Retrieve the record with the maximum value

Example 25: Sort data in the `student` table by `score` in descending order and retrieve the first row to obtain the record with the maximum `score` value.

```sql
SELECT id, name, score
FROM student
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+-------+
| id | name     | score |
+----+----------+-------+
|  6 | Benjamin |  96.5 |
+----+----------+-------+
1 row in set
```

#### Retrieve the m rows of records following the n skipped rows of records

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>When less than m rows remain after you skip n rows, all the remaining data is returned in the query result. </p>
</main>

Example 26: Retrieve the three rows after the fifth row in the `student` table and return the data of the `id` and `name` columns.

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
|  6 | Benjamin |
|  7 | Ava      |
|  8 | Michael  |
+----+----------+
3 rows in set
```

### Paging queries

In SQL queries, the `LIMIT` clause can be used to implement paging queries.


The format for paging queries with the `LIMIT` clause is as follows:

```sql
LIMIT (page_no - 1) * page_size, page_size;
```

where

* `page_no` specifies the page number that starts from 1. The value range is \[1,+∞).

* `page_size` specifies the number of records per page. The value range is \[1,+∞). For example, if `page_no` is set to 5 and `page_size` is set to 10, the 10 records on page 5 are retrieved.

Example 27: In the `student` table, set `page_size` to 2 to retrieve data of page 1, page 2, and page 3.

Page 1:

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 0,2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+---------+
| id | name    |
+----+---------+
|  1 | Emma    |
|  2 | William |
+----+---------+
2 rows in set
```

Page 2:

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 2,2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+--------+
| id | name   |
+----+--------+
|  3 | Olivia |
|  4 | James  |
+----+--------+
2 rows in set
```

Page 3:

```sql
SELECT id, name
FROM student
ORDER BY id
LIMIT 4,2;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
|  5 | Sophia   |
|  6 | Benjamin |
+----+----------+
2 rows in set
```
