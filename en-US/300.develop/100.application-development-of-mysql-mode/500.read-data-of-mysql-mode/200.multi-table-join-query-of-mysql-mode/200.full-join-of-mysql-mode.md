# FULL JOIN queries

A FULL JOIN query is a full (outer) join query that returns all rows in all joins, no matter whether they match.

## Background information

An OUTER JOIN query uses a comparison operator to compare the data in two tables. The join results include the rows that meet the join conditions and those do not meet the join conditions.

OUTER JOIN queries include FULL JOIN queries, LEFT JOIN queries, and RIGHT JOIN queries. An OUTER JOIN query returns all the rows that meet the join conditions. In addition, it returns unused rows of one table and fills `NULL` in the corresponding positions in the other table.

This topic describes how to use FULL JOIN queries. For more information about LEFT JOIN queries and RIGHT JOIN queries, see [LEFT JOIN queries](../200.multi-table-join-query-of-mysql-mode/300.left-join-of-mysql-mode.md) and [RIGHT JOIN queries](../200.multi-table-join-query-of-mysql-mode/400.right-join-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Syntax

Generally, an `OUTER JOIN` statement contains a left-side table and a right-side table. The leftmost table in the `JOIN` clause is the left-side table, and the rightmost table in the `JOIN` clause is the right-side table.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name1 FULL JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition
[ WHERE query_condition ]
[ ORDER BY column_list ];
```

Here, `table_name1` is the left-side table and `table_name2` is the right-side table.

## Examples

Create a table and insert proper data into the table.

```sql
obclient [info]> CREATE TABLE tbl_a(id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [info]> CREATE TABLE tbl_b(number INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, value INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [info]> INSERT INTO tbl_a VALUES(1,'ab'),(2,'cd'),(3,'ef'),(4,'gh');
Query OK, 6 rows affected
Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient [info]> INSERT INTO tbl_b VALUES(1,1001),(3,1003),(5,1005);
Query OK, 4 rows affected
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Simple FULL JOIN queries

If no matching row can be found in the left-side table or right-side table for a FULL JOIN query, the system will automatically fill in `NULL`.

For example, execute a FULL JOIN query on the `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` tables and obtain the results.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a FULL JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    1 | ab   |      1 |  1001 |
|    2 | cd   |   NULL |  NULL |
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
|    4 | gh   |   NULL |  NULL |
| NULL | NULL |      5 |  1005 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
5 rows in set
```

In this example, the `tbl_a` table does not contain any row with the value `5`. Therefore, this row is filled with `NULL` in the returned result. The `tbl_b` table does not contain any row with the value `2` or `4`. Therefore, these two rows are filled with `NULL` in the returned result.

### FULL JOIN queries with a WHERE clause

You can use a FULL JOIN query to obtain the join result and then use the `WHERE` clause to filter the result.

For example, execute a FULL JOIN query on tables `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` and return the data that meets the `value=1003` condition in the `tbl_b` table.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a FULL JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number WHERE tbl_b.value=1003;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
1 row in set
```
