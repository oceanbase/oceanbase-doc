# Lateral derived table

This topic describes the basic concept and limitations on lateral derived tables, and provides some examples to introduce how to use lateral derived tables. 

## Concept

A derived table is a subquery used in a `FROM` clause. The result set of this subquery is temporarily used as a table in outer queries. A derived table is usually used to group and aggregate data, or used to create a dataset that meets the specified conditions for use in the main query. 

Lateral derived tables are a special type of derived tables. You can use the `LATERAL` keyword to specify a lateral derived table so that it can reference fields in another table or derived table previously defined in the same `FROM` clause. This way, a subquery in the lateral derived table can reference tables defined in the same `FROM` clause and access column values in these tables. 

A lateral derived table differs from a normal derived table in that it can reference columns in tables that are previously defined in the same `FROM` clause. 

## Limitations

* The `LATERAL` keyword must be used in the `FROM` clause. It can be in a list of tables separated with commas (,) or in a join expression, such as `JOIN`, `INNER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, `LEFT [OUTER] JOIN`, or `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`. 
* When the `LATERAL` keyword is used in a `JOIN` statement to reference fields in a left-side table, supported join types are `INNER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, and `LEFT [OUTER] JOIN`. 
* When the `LATERAL` keyword is used in a `JOIN` statement to reference fields in a right-side table, supported joint types are `INNER JOIN`, `CROSS JOIN`, and `RIGHT [OUTER] JOIN`. 
* If an aggregate function is referenced in a lateral derived table, this aggregate function cannot directly depend on the external query where the `FROM` clause that contains the lateral derived table resides. In other words, a lateral derived table cannot use an aggregate function to directly reference the result of an external query. 

## Syntax

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM table_name1,
LATERAL (SELECT select_list
         FROM table_name2
         WHERE table_name2.col_name = table_name1.col_name) AS lateral_derived_table_name
[...];
```

Parameters in the syntax are described as follows:

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------|----------|
| select_list | The list of columns to retrieve, which can be column names, expressions, or aggregate functions. Separate multiple columns with commas (,).  |
| table_name1 | The primary table to query.  |
| LATERAL | A lateral join subquery, namely, a lateral derived table.  |
| table_name2 | A secondary table referenced in the `LATERAL` subquery to provide related additional information for each row in the primary table specified by `table_name1`.  |
| lateral_derived_table_name | The alias of the secondary table, which is referenced in subsequent queries.  |
| [...] | An optional query clause, such as a `WHERE` clause.  |

## Examples

### Create a test table and add test data to the table

1. Create a table named `students`. 

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE students (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     age INT
   );
   ```

2. Insert three data records into the `students` table. 

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO students (name, age)
     VALUES ('name1', 20),
     ('name2', 22),
     ('name3', 21);
   ```

3. Create a table named `scores`. 

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE scores (
     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
     student_id INT,
     subject VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     score DECIMAL(5, 2),
     FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(id)
   );
   ```

4. Insert nine data records into the `scores` table. 

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO scores (student_id, subject, score)
     VALUES (1, 'A', 86.5),
     (1, 'B', 90.0),
     (1, 'C', 91.5),
     (2, 'A', 86.0),
     (2, 'B', 92.0),
     (2, 'C', 89.5),
     (3, 'A', 93.0),
     (3, 'B', 92.5),
     (3, 'C', 85.0);
   ```

### Query the test data

Query the `students` and `scores` tables for the name, average score, and highest score of each student. 

Q1: Use multiple subqueries to obtain required data. Perform a group operation and an aggregate operation on the `scores` table. Scan the `scores` table twice to calculate the average score and highest score of each student. Then, use the `WHERE` clause to join the results with the `students` table. 

```sql
SELECT st.name, sc.avg_score, scs.max_score
FROM students st,
  (SELECT student_id, AVG(score) avg_score
   FROM scores
   GROUP BY student_id) sc,
   (SELECT student_id, MAX(score) max_score
   FROM scores
   GROUP BY student_id) scs
WHERE sc.student_id = st.id
AND scs.student_id = st.id;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------+-----------+-----------+
| name  | avg_score | max_score |
+-------+-----------+-----------+
| name1 | 89.333333 |     91.50 |
| name2 | 89.166667 |     92.00 |
| name3 | 90.166667 |     93.00 |
+-------+-----------+-----------+
3 rows in set
```

Q2: Use the `LATERAL` keyword to obtain required data. Use the `LATERAL` keyword (lateral derived table) to calculate the average score and highest score of each student in an SQL statement, and scan the `scores` table once for the ID of each student. 

```sql
SELECT st.name, ld_tbl.avg_score, ld_tbl.max_score
FROM students st,
  LATERAL (SELECT AVG(score) avg_score, MAX(score) max_score
           FROM scores sc
           WHERE sc.student_id = st.id) ld_tbl;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------+-----------+-----------+
| name  | avg_score | max_score |
+-------+-----------+-----------+
| name1 | 89.333333 |     91.50 |
| name2 | 89.166667 |     92.00 |
| name3 | 90.166667 |     93.00 |
+-------+-----------+-----------+
3 rows in set
```

Q2 has higher performance than Q1 in processing a large dataset because it avoids repeatedly scanning the `scores` table. The syntax of Q2 is clearer and more compact and easier to understand and maintain.
