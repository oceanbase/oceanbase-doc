# Connect to OceanBase Database by using DBeaver

DBeaver is a universal database client. It connects to a database through the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) driver provided by this database. It supports normal relational databases, non-relational databases, and distributed databases.

You can connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the OceanBase or MySQL driver that comes with DBeaver. This topic describes how to connect to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using the OceanBase driver of DBeaver.

## Prerequisites

* You have downloaded and installed DBeaver. You can download the DBeaver installation package for your operating system from the [DBeaver Community](https://dbeaver.io/download/) website.

* The IP address of the OBServer node to be connected has access to the server where DBeaver is installed.
