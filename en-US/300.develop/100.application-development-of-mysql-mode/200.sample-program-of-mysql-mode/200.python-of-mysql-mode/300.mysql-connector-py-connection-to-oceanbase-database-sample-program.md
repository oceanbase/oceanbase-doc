# Connect to OceanBase Database by using MySQL Connector/Python

This topic describes how to connect to and use OceanBase Database by using the Python driver MySQL Connector/Python.

## Prerequisites

* You have installed Python2.7 or 3.x and pip.
* You have installed OceanBase Database and created a MySQL tenant.

## Procedure

The main steps are as follows:

1. Obtain the OceanBase Database connection string.
2. Install the MySQL Connector/Python driver.
3. Edit the database connection information in the `test.py` file.
4. Run the `test.py` file.

### Step 1: Obtain a database connection string

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the connection string.

```
obclient -h$host -P$port -u$user_name -p$password -D$database_name
```

where

* `$host` indicates the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is the IP address of an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) for connection through ODP, or the IP address of an OBServer node for direct connection.
* `$port` indicates the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `$database_name` indicates the name of the database to be accessed.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>The user for connecting to a tenant must have the <code>CREATE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DROP</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on the database. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md">Privilege types in MySQL mode</a>. </p>
    </main>

* `$user_name` indicates the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `Username@Tenant name#Cluster name` or `Cluster name:Tenant name:Username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `Username@Tenant name` format.
* `$password` indicates the password of the account.

For more information about the connection string, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/300.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md).

Here is an example:

```shell
obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -Dtest
```

### Step 2: Install the MySQL Connector/Python driver

MySQL Connector/Python is an official driver provided by MySQL for connecting to MySQL databases. It is written in Python and used to connect to and operate MySQL databases in Python. MySQL Connector/Python supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.

For more information about MySQL Connector/Python, visit [Introduction to MySQL Connector/Python](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-introduction.html).

The installation code for Python 3 is as follows:

```
pip3 install mysql-connector-python
```

Check whether MySQL Connector/Python has been installed, and view the details.

```
pip3 show mysql-connector-python
```

### Step 3: Write an application

Open your text editor, write a sample `test.py` file, and save it. The sample code is as follows:

```
import mysql.connector

# Create a connection.
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="xxxx",  
    port=xxxx,
    user="xxx",
    password="",
    charset=""utf8mb4"
)

# Create a database.
def create_database(cursor):
    cursor.execute("CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS testdb")
    cursor.execute("USE testdb")

# Create a table.
def create_table(cursor):
    cursor.execute("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255))")

# Insert data.
def insert_data(cursor):
    sql = "INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (%s, %s)"
    val = ("111", "111@example.com")
    cursor.execute(sql, val)
    cnx.commit()
    print("Data inserted, ID:", cursor.lastrowid)

# Modify data.
def update_data(cursor):
    sql = "UPDATE users SET email = %s WHERE name = %s"
    val = ("222@example.com", "111")
    cursor.execute(sql, val)
    cnx.commit()
    print(cursor.rowcount, "record(s) affected")

# Query data.
def select_data(cursor):
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    result = cursor.fetchall()
    for row in result:
        print(row)

# Obtain a cursor object.
cursor = cnx.cursor()

# Create a database and use it.
create_database(cursor)
create_table(cursor)

# Insert data.
insert_data(cursor)

# Modify data.
update_data(cursor)

# Query data.
select_data(cursor)

# Close the cursor and connection.
cursor.close()
cnx.close()
```

Modify the database connection information in the `test.py` file based on the connection string obtained in **Step 1**.

* In Windows, use the text editor to open the `test.py` file and modify the database connection information in the file based on the actual situation.
* In Linux, use the `vi test.py` or `vim test.py` command to edit the `test.py` file and modify the database connection information in the file based on the actual situation.

Here is an example of the database connection information in the `test.py` file:

```python
# Modify the connection information based on the obtained connection string.
cnx = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="10.10.10.1",  
    port=2881,
    user="test_user001@mysql001",
    password="test",
    charset="utf8"
)
```

### Step 4: Run the application

Start a command-line tool or a PowerShell client and run the `test.py` file to query data and output the query result.

1. Go to the directory where the `test.py` file is located.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   cd D:\demo\demo
   ```

2. Run the `test.py` file.

   ```shell
   python3 test.py
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Data inserted, ID: 1
   1 record(s) affected
   # Query result
   (1, '111', '222@example.com')
   ```
