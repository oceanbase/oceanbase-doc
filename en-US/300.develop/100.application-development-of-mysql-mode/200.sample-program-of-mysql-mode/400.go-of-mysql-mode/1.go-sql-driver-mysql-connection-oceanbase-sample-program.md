## Prerequisites

You have completed the following preparations and correctly configured the corresponding environment variable:

* Install OceanBase Database
* Install Go
* Install Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL

## Procedure

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The steps outlined in this topic are for the Windows environment. If you are using a different operating system or compiler, the steps may vary slightly.</p>
</main>

1. (Optional) Install Go and Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL.
2. Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database.
3. Modify the database connection information in the `go-oceanbase` project.
4. Run the `go-oceanbase` project.

### Step 1: (Optional) Install Go and Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL

If you have installed Go and Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL, skip this step. If you have not installed them, perform the following operations:

1. Install Go.

   1. Download the Go installation package that suits your operating system from the [Go official website](https://golang.org/dl/).

        <main id="notice" type='explain'>
         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>The installation package used in this topic is <code>go1.20.6.windows-amd64.msi</code>. </p>
        </main>

   2. Double-click the installation package and follow the wizard to install Go.

   3. Add the installation path of Go to the `Path` environment variable of the system.
      * In a Windows environment, choose **Control Panel** > **System and Security** > **System** > **Advanced system settings** > **Environment Variables** > **System variables** and add `C:\usr\local\go\bin` to the value of **Path**.
      * In a Linux or macOS environment, add the following content in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` file:

         ```shell
         export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
         ```

        <main id="notice" type='explain'>
         <h4>Note</h4>
         <p>Here, <code>\usr\local\go\bin</code> is the default installation directory of Go. If you select another directory when you install Go, replace the default directory with the actual one. </p>
        </main>

   4. Enter the following command in the command-line terminal to check the version of Go, thus verifying the installation:

      ```shell
      C:\Users\admin\> go version
      go version go1.20.6 windows/amd64
      ```

2. Install Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL.

   You can install Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL by using different methods based on the version of Go. To install Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL, you must open a command-line terminal in the project directory. For more information about `Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL`, see [GitHub](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).

   The commands are as follows:

   ```shell
   C:\Users\admin\Desktop\go-oceanbase>go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
   go: downloading github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.7.1
   go: added github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.7.1
   ```

   If you cannot use the `go get` command due to version or network issues, you can run the `go install` command for installation.

   1. Clone the `go-sql-driver/mysql` repository from GitHub to the `go/src` directory.

      ```bash
      cd /usr/local/go/src   
      git clone https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.git
      ```

        <main id="notice" type='notice'>
            <h4>Notice</h4>
            <p>You must replace <code>/usr/local/go/src</code> with the actual installation directory of Go. </p>
        </main>

   2. Run the `go install` command.

      ```bash
      go install mysql
      ```

        <main id="notice" type='notice'>
            <h4>Notice</h4>
            <p>For some Go versions, the default running directory for the <code>go install</code> command may not be <code>/src</code>. You can determine the correct directory based on the error reported after you run the <code>go install</code> command. For example, if the following error is reported: <code>cannot find package "mysql" in: /usr/local/go/src/vendor/mysql</code>, you must put the <code>mysql</code> folder in the <code>/src/vendor</code> directory and then run the <code>go install</code> command. </p>
        </main>

   3. Check whether Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL has been installed. If the installation fails, make corrections based on the error message.

      ```bash
      go list -m github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
      ```

### Step 2: Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database

Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the database connection string.

```sql
obclient  -h{host} -u{username} -p****** -P{port} -D{schema_name}
```

The database connection string contains parameters required for accessing OceanBase Database. You can log on to OceanBase Database by using the database connection string, to verify that the parameters are correct.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
 <h4>Note</h4>
 <p>The URL obtained here is required in the <code>test.go</code> file. </p>
</main>

Parameters in the connection string are described as follows:

* `host`: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
* `user_name`: the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `username@tenant name` format.
* `password`: the account password.
* `port`: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
* `schema_name`: the name of the schema to access.

### Step 3: Modify the database connection information in the `go-oceanbase` project

Modify the database connection information in the `test.go` file based on the information obtained in **Step 2: Obtain the connection information of OceanBase Database**. Select and right-click the `test.go` file, choose **Open With**, and select **Notepad** or another editor to open the file.

<!-- ![test.go](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/demo/Go/testgo.jpg) -->

Here is an example:

* The IP address of the OBServer node is `10.10.10.1`.
* The port is 2881.
* The name of the schema to access is `test`.
* The tenant account is `root@mysql`. `root@mysql` is a user tenant created in MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.
* The password is `******`.

The sample code is as follows:

```go
conn := "root@mysql:******@tcp(10.10.10.1:2881)/test"
```

### Step 4: Run the `go-oceanbase` project

After the code is compiled, open a command-line terminal in the project directory and enter the `go run` command to run the Go file.

```shell
C:\Users\admin\Desktop\go-oceanbase>go run test.go
```

(Optional) In a Linux or macOS environment, you must configure a temporary environment variable before you run `go run`.

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
go run test.go
```

If the following information is returned, you have connected to OceanBase Database, and the sample project runs properly.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This result is returned for the execution where code for dropping the table t1 is commented out.  </p>
</main>

```shell
C:\Users\admin\Desktop\go-oceanbase>go run test.go
success to connect OceanBase with go_mysql driver
Hello OceanBase
```

## Project code introduction

Click [go-oceanbase](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/demo/Go/go-oceanbase.zip) to download the project code, which is a compressed file named `go-oceanbase`.

After decompressing it, you will find a folder named `go-oceanbase`. The directory structure is as follows:

```go
|-- go.mod
|-- go.sum
|-- test.go
```

Here is a breakdown of the files and directories:

* `go.mod`: the Go module file that defines the project's dependencies on other modules and versions of the modules.
* `go.sum`: the module management file for Go 1.11 and later. It records the project's dependencies on other modules and versions of the modules, as well as the corresponding checksums.
* `test.go`: the Go source code file that contains sample code for the project.

### Code in go.mod

The `go.mod` file defines the module name, Go version, and dependencies of the project.

Code in the `go.mod` file contains the following parts:

* `module go-oceanbase`: the name of the module, which defines the project namespace. In Go 1.16 and later, the module name must match the name of the root directory of the project.
* `go 1.20`: the Go version required for the project.
* `require github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.7.1 // indirect`: the dependency declaration of the project. It declares that the project depends on the `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` module of version 1.7.1, and that the dependency is an indirect dependency associated with the `go.sum` dependency.

### Code in go.sum

The `go.sum` file defines the version of the `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` dependency to ensure that the project uses the correct version.

Code in the `go.sum` file contains the following parts:

* `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.7.1 h1:lUIinVbN1DY0xBg0eMOzmmtGoHwWBbvnWubQUrtU8EI=`:
   provides the hash value of the source code file of the module, which ensures that the correct version is used when the project is built. The hash value here is `lUIinVbN1DY0xBg0eMOzmmtGoHwWBbvnWubQUrtU8EI=`.
* `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql v1.7.1/go.mod h1:OXbVy3sEdcQ2Doequ6Z5BW6fXNQTmx+9S1MCJN5yJMI=`:
   provides the hash value of the dependency file of the module, which ensures that the correct dependency version is used when the project is built. The hash value here is `OXbVy3sEdcQ2Doequ6Z5BW6fXNQTmx+9S1MCJN5yJMI=`.

### Code in test.go

The `test.go` file defines how to use Go to interact with the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, including operations such as connecting to the database, creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and dropping tables.

To configure the `test.go` file, perform the following steps:

1. Define the `main` package.

   `package main` indicates that this package is an executable program package that contains a `main()` function. The function is executed when the program runs.

2. Define `import` packages.

   The `import` statement imports the following four packages:

   * `database/sql`: provides common SQL database access interfaces. It defines a set of common interfaces and functions for connecting to and operating various types of SQL databases.
   * `fmt`: provides functions to format input and output. It defines a set of functions for formatting data into strings and outputting them to the console or other devices.
   * `log`: provides logging functions. It defines a set of functions for outputting logs to the console or other devices.
   * `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`: provides the driver in MySQL mode. It implements the interfaces defined in the `database/sql` package for connecting to and operating the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database by using Go. You need to specify the correct installation path of Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL here.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```go
   import (
   "database/sql"
   "fmt"
   "log"

   _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"
   // Specify the installation path of Go-SQL-Driver/MySQL.
   )
   ```

3. Define the `Str` structure.

   The structure contains the `Name` field for storing query results. In the structure, define the `main()` function, which contains the `selectAll()` function for creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and dropping tables.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```go
   type Str struct {
   Name string
   }

   func main() {
   selectAll()
   }
   ```

4. Define the `selectAll()` function.

   The `selectAll()` function includes operations of connecting to the database, creating tables, inserting data, querying data, and dropping tables.

   1. Connect to the database.
      
      1. Define the connection string `conn`, which contains the connection parameters for the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, including the username, password, IP address, port number, and database name.
      2. Call the `sql.Open()` function to open the database connection. If an error occurs, log the error and exit the program.
      3. Use the `defer` keyword to defer the closure of the database connection, ensuring that the connection is closed after the function is executed.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```go
      conn := "user_name:******@tcp(host:port)/schema_name"
      // Database connection parameters

      db, err := sql.Open("mysql", conn)
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }
      ```

   2. Print messages to the console.
      
      1. Use the `defer` keyword to defer the execution of the `db.Close()` function, which ensures that the database connection is closed after the function is executed.
      2. Use the `fmt.Printf()` function to output a successful connection message to the console.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```go
      defer db.Close()

      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }

      fmt.Printf("success to connect OceanBase with go_mysql driver\n")
      ```

   3. Create a table.
      Create a table named `t1` that contains the `str` field of the `varchar(256)` type.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```go
          _, err = db.Query("create table t1(str varchar(256))")
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }
      ```

   4. Insert data.
      Insert a row where `str` is `Hello OceanBase` into the `t1` table.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```go
      _, err = db.Query("insert into t1 values ('Hello OceanBase')")
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }
      ```

   5. Query data.
      Query all data in the `t1` table and assign the query result to the variable `res`. Return an error message if the query fails.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```go
      res, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM t1")
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }
      defer res.Close()

      for res.Next() {
          var str Str
          res.Scan(&str.Name)
          fmt.Printf("%s\n", str.Name)
      }
      ```

   6. Drop a table.
      Drop the `t1` table. Return an error message if the operation fails.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```go
      _, err = db.Query("drop table t1")
      if err != nil {
          log.Fatal(err)
      }
      ```
