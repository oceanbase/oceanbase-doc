# Roll back a transaction

This topic describes how to roll back a transaction.

Rolling back a transaction is to revoke all the changes made in the transaction. Before a transaction is committed, you can roll back the entire transaction or roll back the transaction to any savepoint.

## Roll back an entire transaction

Before you commit a transaction, you can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the entire transaction.

After you roll back an entire transaction, note that:

* All modifications made to the transaction are discarded.

* All savepoints are cleared.

* All locks held by the transaction are released.

The syntax for rolling back an entire transaction is as follows:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

In the following example, `ROLLBACK` is used to revoke all modifications made by the current transaction.

```sql
obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
| id | name | value | gmt_create          |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  3 | EN   | 10003 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  4 | JP   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:51:44 |
|  5 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:53:56 |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
5 rows in set

obclient [test]> BEGIN;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name, value) VALUES(6,'JP',10007);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient [test]> INSERT INTO ordr(id, name, value) VALUES(8,'FR',10008),(9,'RU',10009);
Query OK, 2 rows affected

obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
| id | name | value | gmt_create          |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  3 | EN   |  1003 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  4 | JP   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:51:44 |
|  5 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:53:56 |
|  6 | JP   | 10007 | 2022-10-19 14:58:24 |
|  8 | FR   | 10008 | 2022-10-19 14:58:35 |
|  9 | RU   | 10009 | 2022-10-19 14:58:35 |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
8 rows in set

obclient [test]> ROLLBACK;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [test]> SELECT * FROM ordr;
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
| id | name | value | gmt_create          |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10001 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  2 | US   | 10002 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  3 | EN   |  1003 | 2022-10-19 14:51:12 |
|  4 | JP   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:51:44 |
|  5 | CN   |  NULL | 2022-10-19 14:53:56 |
+----+------+-------+---------------------+
5 rows in set
```

In this example, `BEGIN` is used to start a transaction. Before `COMMIT` is used to commit the transaction, all modifications are visible only to the current session, and are not persisted. You can use the `ROLLBACK` statement to roll back the modifications.

## Roll back a transaction to a savepoint

If savepoints are set for a transaction, you can use the `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` statement to roll back the transaction to a savepoint. For more information about transaction savepoints, see [Mark a savepoint](300.transaction-savepoints-of-mysql-mode/100.mark-a-savepoint-of-mysql-mode.md).

After you roll back a transaction to a specific savepoint, note that:

* The transaction does not end.

* Modifications made before the savepoint are retained but those made after it are discarded.

* All savepoints after the specific savepoint are cleared.

* All locks held by the transaction after the savepoint are released.

The syntax for rolling back a transaction to a specific savepoint is as follows:

```sql
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT pointname;
```

Here, `pointname` specifies the name of the transaction savepoint.
