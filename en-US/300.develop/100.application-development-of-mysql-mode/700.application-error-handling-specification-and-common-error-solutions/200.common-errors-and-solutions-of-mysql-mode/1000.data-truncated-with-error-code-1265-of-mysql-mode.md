# Data truncated while being inserted, with ERROR 1265 reported

This topic describes how to handle `ERROR 1265`, where data was truncated while being inserted to the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.

## Symptom

When data is inserted into the `ty` table, an error is reported indicating that the data was truncated.

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO ty VALUE('1970-01-01');
ERROR 1265 (01000): Data truncated for argument
```

The error codes corresponding to this error message are as follows:

* Error code: ERROR 1265

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4249

* Error code compatible with MySQL Database: 1265

For more information about the error codes, see [Overview of error messages](../../../../700.reference/900.error-code/600.error-code-of-mysql-mode/100.use-error-information-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Possible causes

The length of the inserted value exceeds the maximum length allowed for the column.

## Troubleshooting procedure

Perform the following steps to view the type and length of each field in the current table and insert an invalid value.

1. View the schema of the current table `ty`.

   ```sql
   obclient> DESC ty;
   +-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | Field | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
   +-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   | c1    | year(4) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
   +-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

2. Insert a valid value based on the field type.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO ty VALUE('1970');
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   ```

3. View the inserted data. Data is properly inserted.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM ty;
   +------+
   | c1   |
   +------+
   | 1970 |
   +------+
   1 row in set
   ```
