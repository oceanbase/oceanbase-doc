# Delete data

After you insert data into a table, you can use the `DELETE` statement or other statements to delete records from the table. This topic describes how to use related statements.

## Prerequisites

Before you delete data from a table, make sure that:

* You have connected to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database. For more information about how to connect to OceanBase Database, see [Connection methods](../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>You can query the <code>oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS</code> view in the <code>sys</code> tenant to confirm the mode of the tenant to which you have logged on.</p>
  </main>

* You have the `DELETE` privilege on the target table. To use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to clear the data in a table, you must also have the `CREATE` privilege on the table. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the required privileges, contact the administrator to obtain the privileges. For more information, see [Grant direct privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/200.authority-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Use the DELETE statement to delete data

Generally, the [DELETE](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/3200.delete-of-mysql-mode.md) statement is used to delete part of the data or all data from a table.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Besides the <code>DELETE</code> statement, you can also use the <code>REPLACE INTO</code> statement to delete data. For more information about the <code>REPLACE INTO</code> statement, see <a href="400.replace-data-of-mysql-mode-in-develop.md">Replace data</a>. </p>
  </main>

The syntax of a simple `DELETE` statement is as follows:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name [ WHERE condition ];
```

| Parameter | Required? | Description |
|-------------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| table_name | Yes | The table from which data is to be deleted.  |
| [WHERE condition] | No | The condition for deleting data. If no condition is specified, all data in the table is deleted.  |

### Delete part of the data

You can add a `WHERE` condition to the `DELETE` statement to delete the data that meets the condition from a table.

For example, delete all rows that meet the `value = 10004` condition from the `t_insert` table.

```sql
obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value = 10004;
Query OK, 1 row affected
```

### Delete all data

If a table contains a small amount of data, you can directly use the `DELETE` statement to delete all rows.

Here is an example:

* Delete all rows from the `t_insert` table.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert;
   Query OK, 3 row affected
   ```

   For a table that contains millions of records, deleting all the records at a time may result in performance issues. We recommend that you delete the data in batches by using the `WHERE` condition, or **use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to empty a table**.

* Filter the data in the `value` column of the `t_insert` table. Execute multiple statements to respectively delete the data that meets the `value < 10000`, `value < 20000`, and `value < 30000` conditions in batches.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 100000;

   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 200000;

   obclient [test]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 300000;
   ```

## Use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to empty a table

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement clears a table but retains its schema, including the partitions defined for the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to the `DELETE FROM` statement that is used to delete all rows.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name;
```

For example, use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to empty the `t_insert` table.

```sql
obclient [test]> TRUNCATE TABLE t_insert;
```

For more information about the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, see [TRUNCATE TABLE](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/8900.truncate-table-of-mysql-mode.md).
