   ![2](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/connection-pool/druid-oceanbase-client/2.png)

### Step 2: Obtain the URL of OceanBase Database

1. Contact the deployment personnel or administrator of OceanBase Database to obtain the connection string.

   **Here is an example:**

   ```shell
   obclient -hxxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -P2881 -utest_user001@oracel001 -p******
   ```

   For more information about the connection string, see [Connect to an OceanBase tenant by using OBClient](../../100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/200.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Fill in the URL below based on the OceanBase Database connection string.

   ```shell
   jdbc:oceanbase://$host:$port/$schema_name?user=$user_name&password=$password
   ```

   where

   * `$host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
   * `$port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
   * `$schema_name` specifies the name of the schema to be accessed.

        <main id="notice" type='notice'>
          <h4>Notice</h4>
          <p>The user used to connect to the tenant must have the <code>CREATE SESSION</code> privilege and the <code>CREATE TABLE</code>, <code>DROP TABLE</code>, <code>INSERT</code>, <code>DELETE</code>, <code>UPDATE</code>, and <code>SELECT</code> privileges on this schema. For more information about user privileges, see <a href="../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md">Privilege types in Oracle mode</a>. </p>
        </main>

   * `$user_name` specifies the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `username@tenant name` format.
   * `$password` specifies the password of the account.

   For more information about URL parameters in OceanBase Connector/J, see [Database URL](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-connector-j-en-10000000000911660).

   **Here is an example:**

   ```shell
   jdbc:oceanbase://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2881/test_schema001?user=test_user001@oracel001&password=******
   ```

### Step 3: Modify the database connection information in the druid-oceanbase-client project

Modify the database connection information in the `druid-oceanbase-client/src/main/resources/db.properties` file based on the information obtained in **Step 2**.

![3](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/connection-pool/druid-oceanbase-client/3.png)

**Here is an example:**

* The IP address of the OBServer node is `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx`.
* The port is `2881`.
* The name of the schema to be accessed is `test_schema001`.
* The tenant account is `test_user001@oracle001`, where `oracle001` is an Oracle user tenant created in OceanBase Database, and `test_user001` is the username of the `oracle001` tenant.
* The password is `******`.

**The sample code is as follows:**

```java
...
url=jdbc:oceanbase://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:2881/test_schema001
username=test_user001@oracle001
password=******
...
```

### Step 4: Run the druid-oceanbase-client project

1. In the project navigation view, locate and expand the **druid-oceanbase-client/src/main/java** directory.

2. Right-click the **Main.java** file and choose **Run As** > **Java Application**.

   ![4](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/connection-pool/druid-oceanbase-client/4.png)

3. In the console window of Eclipse, view the output results.

## Project code introduction

Click [druid-oceanbase-client](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.0/3.develop/connection-pool/druid-oceanbase-client/druid-oceanbase-client.zip) to download the project code, which is a compressed file named `druid-oceanbase-client.zip`.

After decompressing it, you will find a folder named `druid-oceanbase-client`. The directory structure is as follows:

```shell
druid-oceanbase-client
├── src
│   └── main
│       ├── java
│       │   └── com
│       │       └── example
│       │           └── Main.java
│       └── resources
│           └── db.properties
└── pom.xml
```

Here is a breakdown of the files and directories:

* `src`: the root directory for storing the source code.
* `main`: the directory for storing the main code, including the major logic of the application.
* `java`: the directory for storing the Java source code.
* `com`: the directory for storing the Java package.
* `example`: the directory for storing the packages of the sample project.
* `Main.java`: a sample file of the main class that contains logic for table creation, data insertion, data deletion, data modification, and data query.
* `resources`: the directory for storing resource files, including configuration files.
* `db.properties`: the configuration file of the connection pool, which contains relevant database connection parameters.
* `pom.xml`: the configuration file of the Maven project, which is used to manage project dependencies and build settings.

### Code in the pom.xml file

The `pom.xml` file is a configuration file for Maven projects, which defines the dependencies, plug-ins, and build rules of the projects. Maven is a Java project management tool that can automatically download dependencies, compile, and package the projects.

To configure the `pom.xml` file, perform the following steps:

1. Declare the file.

   Declare the file to be an XML file that uses XML standard `1.0` and character encoding `UTF-8`.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   ```

2. Configure the namespaces and the POM model version.

   1. `xmlns`: the default XML namespace, which is set to `http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0`.
   2. `xmlns:xsi`: the namespace for XML elements prefixed with `xsi`, which is set to `http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance`.
   3. `xsi:schemaLocation`: the mapping between the XML namespace and its corresponding XML schema definition (XSD) file. The value typically consists of paired strings separated by spaces. Each pair consists of a default XML namespace (`http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0`) in the first part, and the URI of the corresponding XSD file (`http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd`) in the second part.
   4. `<modelVersion>`: the POM model version used by the POM file, which is set to `4.0.0`.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
   <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
   
    <! -- Other configurations -->
   
   </project>
   ```

3. Configure basic information.

   1. `<groupId>`: the ID of the group to which the project belongs, which is set to `com.example`.
   2. `<artifactId>`: the name of the project, which is set to `druid-oceanbase-client`.
   3. `<version>`: the project version, which is set to `1.0-SNAPSHOT`.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
       <groupId>com.example</groupId>
       <artifactId>druid-oceanbase-client</artifactId>
       <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
   ```

4. Configure the properties of the project's source file.

   Specify the Maven compiler plug-in as `maven-compiler-plugin`, and set both the source code and target Java versions to 8. This means that the project's source code is written using Java 8, and the compiled bytecode will also be compatible with the Java 8 runtime environment. This setup ensures that the project can correctly handle the syntax and features of Java 8 during compilation and runtime.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Java 1.8 and Java 8 are different names for the same version. </p>
    </main>

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
       <build>
           <plugins>
               <plugin>
                   <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                   <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
                   <configuration>
                       <source>8</source>
                       <target>8</target>
                   </configuration>
               </plugin>
           </plugins>
       </build>
   ```

5. Configure the components on which the project depends.

   1. Add the `oceanbase-client` dependency library for interactions with the database, and configure the following parameters:

      1. `<groupId>`: the ID of the group to which the dependency belongs, which is set to `com.oceanbase`.
      2. `<artifactId>`: the name of the dependency, which is set to `oceanbase-client`.
      3. `<version>`: the version of the dependency, which is set to `2.4.2`.

        <main id="notice" type='explain'>
          <h4>Note</h4>
          <p>The following code defines that the project depends on OceanBase Connector/J V2.4.2. For more information about other versions, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-connector-j-en-10000000001092963">OceanBase Connector/J</a>. </p>
        </main>

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```java
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>com.oceanbase</groupId>
                  <artifactId>oceanbase-client</artifactId>
                  <version>2.4.2</version>
              </dependency>
      ```

   2. Add the `druid` dependency library, and configure the following parameters:

      1. `<groupId>`: the ID of the group to which the dependency belongs, which is set to `com.alibaba`.
      2. `<artifactId>`: the name of the dependency, which is set to `druid`.
      3. `<version>`: the version of the dependency, which is set to `1.2.8`.

      **The sample code is as follows:**

      ```java
              <dependency>
                  <groupId>com.alibaba</groupId>
                  <artifactId>druid</artifactId>
                  <version>1.2.8</version>
              </dependency>
      ```

### Code in the db.properties file

`db.properties` is a sample configuration file of the connection pool. The configuration file contains the URL, username, and password for connecting to the database, and other optional parameters of the connection pool.

To configure the `db.properties` file, perform the following steps:

1. Configure database connection parameters.

   1. Specify the class name of the database driver as `com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver`.
   2. Specify the URL for connecting to the database, including the host IP address, port number, and schema to be accessed.
   3. Specify the username for connecting to the database.
   4. Specify the password for connecting to the database.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
   driverClassName=com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver
   url=jdbc:oceanbase://$host:$port/$schema_name
   username=$user_name
   password=$password
   ```

   where

   * `$host` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), this parameter is the IP address of an ODP. For direct connection, this parameter is the IP address of an OBServer node.
   * `$port` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. For connection through ODP, the default value is `2883`, which can be customized when ODP is deployed. For direct connection, the default value is `2881`, which can be customized when OceanBase Database is deployed.
   * `$schema_name` specifies the name of the schema to be accessed.
   * `$user_name` specifies the tenant account. For connection through ODP, the tenant account can be in the `username@tenant name#cluster name` or `cluster name:tenant name:username` format. For direct connection, the tenant account is in the `username@tenant name` format.
   * `$password` specifies the password of the account.

2. Configure other connection pool parameters.

   1. Specify `select 1 from dual` as the SQL statement for connection verification.
   2. Set the number of initial connections in the connection pool to 3. When the connection pool is started, three initial connections are created.
   3. Set the maximum number of active connections allowed in the connection pool to 30.
   4. Set the value of the parameter that specifies whether to record logs for abandoned connections to `true`. This way, when an abandoned connection is recycled, an error log is recorded. We recommend that you set the value to `true` in a test environment and to `false` in an online environment to avoid compromising the performance.
   5. Set the minimum number of idle connections in the connection pool to 5. When the number of idle connections is less than 5, the connection pool automatically creates new connections.
   6. Set the maximum waiting time for requesting a connection to 1,000 ms. When the application requests a connection from the connection pool, if all connections are occupied, a timeout exception is thrown when the specified waiting time expires.
   7. Set the minimum duration for which a connection can remain idle in the connection pool to 300,000 ms. A connection that has been idle for 300,000 ms (5 minutes) will be recycled.
   8. Set the value of the parameter that specifies whether to recycle abandoned connections to `true`. An abandoned connection is recycled after the time specified by `removeAbandonedTimeout` elapses.
   9. Set the timeout value of an abandoned connection to 300s. An abandoned connection that has not been used in 300s (5 minutes) will be recycled.
   10. Set the interval for scheduling the idle connection recycling thread to 10,000 ms. In other words, the idle connection recycling thread is scheduled every 10,000 ms (10s) to recycle idle connections.
   11. Set the value of the parameter that specifies whether to verify a connection when it is requested to `false`. This can improve the performance. However, the obtained connection may be unavailable.
   12. Set the value of the parameter that specifies whether to verify a connection when it is returned to the connection pool to `false`. This can improve the performance. However, the connection returned to the connection pool may be unavailable.
   13. Set the value of the parameter that specifies whether to verify idle connections to `true`. When the value is set to `true`, the connection pool periodically executes the statement specified by `validationQuery` to verify the availability of connections.
   14. Set the value of the parameter that specifies whether to enable connection keepalive to `false`. The value `false` specifies to disable connection keepalive.
   15. Set the maximum idle period of connections to 60,000 ms. If the idle period of a connection exceeds 60,000 ms (1 minute), the connection keepalive mechanism will check the connection to ensure its availability. If any operation is performed in the connection during the idle period, the idle period is recounted.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
   validationQuery=select 1 from dual
   initialSize=3
   maxActive=30
   logAbandoned=true
   minIdle=5
   maxWait=1000
   minEvictableIdleTimeMillis=300000
   removeAbandoned=true
   removeAbandonedTimeout=300
   timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis=10000
   testOnBorrow=false
   testOnReturn=false
   testWhileIdle=true
   keepAlive=false
   keepAliveBetweenTimeMillis=60000
   ```

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>The actual parameter configurations depend on the project requirements and database characteristics. We recommend that you adjust and configure the parameters based on the actual situation. </p>
</main>

**The following table describes the general Druid parameters.**

| Parameter | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| url | The URL for connecting to the database. The value contains the database type, host name, port number, and database name.  |
| username | The username for connecting to the database.  |
| password | The password for connecting to the database.  |
| driverClassName | The name of the database driver class. If the `driverClassName` parameter is not explicitly configured, the Druid connection pool automatically identifies the database type (dbType) based on the URL and selects the corresponding `driverClassName`. This automatic identification mechanism can reduce the configuration workload and simplify the configuration process. However, if the URL cannot be correctly parsed or a nonstandard database driver class is required, the `driverClassName` parameter must be explicitly configured to ensure that the correct driver class is loaded.  |
| initialSize | The number of connections created during the initialization of the connection pool. When the application is started, the connection pool will create the specified number of connections.  |
| maxActive | The maximum number of active connections in the connection pool. When the specified value is reached, subsequent connection requests have to wait until a connection is released.  |
| maxIdle | The maximum number of idle connections in the connection pool. This parameter has been deprecated. When the specified value is reached, excess connections are closed.  |
| minIdle | The minimum number of idle connections in the connection pool. When the number of idle connection in the connection pool is lower than the specified value, the connection pool will create new connections.  |
| maxWait | The maximum waiting time for requesting a connection, in ms. If you specify a positive value, it indicates the amount of time to wait. An exception is thrown if no connection is obtained when the specified time expires.  |
| poolPreparedStatements | Specifies whether to cache prepared statements. If you set the value to `true`, prepared statements will be cached to improve the performance.  |
| validationQuery | The SQL query statement for verifying connections. When a connection is obtained from the connection pool, this query statement is executed to verify its validity.  |
| timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis | The interval for detecting idle connections in the connection pool, in ms. A connection that has been idle for a period of time exceeding the value specified by `timeBetweenEvictionRunsMillis` will be closed.  |
| minEvictableIdleTimeMillis | The minimum duration for which a connection can remain idle in the connection pool, in ms. A connection that has been idle for a period of time exceeding the specified value will be recycled. If you specify a negative value, idle connections will not be recycled.  |
| testWhileIdle | Specifies whether to verify idle connections. If you set the value to `true`, the statement specified by `validationQuery` is executed to verify idle connections.  |
| testOnBorrow | Specifies whether to verify a connection when it is obtained. If you set the value to `true`, the statement specified by `validationQuery` is executed to verify whether an obtained connection is valid.  |
| testOnReturn | Specifies whether to verify a connection when it is returned to the connection pool. If you set the value to `true`, the statement specified by `validationQuery` is executed to verify a connection when it is returned to the connection pool.  |
| filters | A series of predefined filters in the connection pool. These filters can be used to preprocess and postprocess connections in a specific order to provide additional features and enhance the performance of the connection pool. General filters are described as follows:<ol><li>`stat`: collects statistics about the performance metrics of the connection pool, such as the number of active connections, number of requests, and number of errors. </li><li>`wall`: used in the SQL firewall to block and disable insecure SQL statements, thereby improving the security of the database. </li><li>`log4j`: outputs logs of the connection pool to `Log4j` to facilitate log recording and debugging. </li><li>`slf4j`: outputs logs of the connection pool to Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J) to facilitate log recording and debugging. </li><li>`config`: loads configuration information of the connection pool from an external configuration file. </li><li>`encoding`: sets the character encoding format used between the connection pool and the database. </li></ol>After you configure these filters in the `filters` parameter, the connection pool applies them in the specified order. You can separate filter names with commas (,), for example, `filters=stat,wall,log4j`.  |

### Code in the Main.java file

The `Main.java` file is the main program of the sample application in this topic. It demonstrates how to use the data source, connection objects, and various database operation methods to interact with the database.

To configure the `Main.java` file, perform the following steps:

1. Import the required classes and interfaces.

   1. Declare the name of the package to which the current code belongs as `com.example`.
   2. Import the Java class `IOException` for handling input/output exceptions.
   3. Import the Java class `InputStream` for obtaining input streams from files or other sources.
   4. Import the Java interface `Connection` for representing connections with the database.
   5. Import the Java interface `ResultSet` for representing datasets of database query results.
   6. Import the Java class `SQLException` for handling SQL exceptions.
   7. Import the Java interface `Statement` for executing SQL statements.
   8. Import the Java interface `PreparedStatement` for representing precompiled SQL statements.
   9. Import the Java class `Properties` for processing the configuration file.
   10. Import the Java interface `DataSource` for managing database connections.
   11. Import the `DruidDataSourceFactory` class of Alibaba Druid for creating Druid data sources.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
   package com.example;
   
   import java.io.IOException;
   import java.io.InputStream;
   import java.sql.Connection;
   import java.sql.ResultSet;
   import java.sql.SQLException;
   import java.sql.Statement;
   import java.sql.PreparedStatement;
   import java.util.Properties;
   import javax.sql.DataSource;
   import com.alibaba.druid.pool.DruidDataSourceFactory;
   ```

2. Create a `Main` class and define a `main` method.

   Define a `Main` class and a `main` method. The `main` method demonstrates how to use the connection pool to execute a series of operations in the database. The specific steps are as follows:

   1. Define a `Main` public class, which is used as the entry to the application. The class name must be the same as the file name.
   2. Define a public static method `main` as the entry to the application to receive command-line options.
   3. Capture and handle possible exceptions by using the exception handling mechanism.
   4. Call the `loadPropertiesFile` method to load the configuration file and return a `Properties` object.
   5. Call the `createDataSource()` method to create a data source object based on the configuration file.
   6. Use the `try-with-resources` block to obtain a database connection and automatically close the connection after use.

      1. Call the `createTable()` method to create a table.
      2. Call the `insertData()` method to insert data.
      3. Call the `selectData()` method to query data.
      4. Call the `updateData()` method to update data.
      5. Call the `selectData()` method again to query the updated data.
      6. Call the `deleteData()` method to delete data.
      7. Call the `selectData()` method again to query data after the deletion.
      8. Call the `dropTable()` method to drop the table.

   **The sample code is as follows:**

   ```java
   public class Main {
   
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           try {
               Properties properties = loadPropertiesFile();
               DataSource dataSource = createDataSource(properties);
               try (Connection conn = dataSource.getConnection()) {
                   // Create a table.
                   createTable(conn);
                   // Insert data.
