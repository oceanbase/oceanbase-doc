# Common statistical events

## Overview

This topic describes some statistical events in the `V$SYSSTAT` view. You can use these statistics to identify and rectify performance issues.
The `V$SESSTAT` view can display statistical event information for every session. The statistical event information is valid only for the currently connected session. When a session is disconnected, all statistical event information of the session is cleared from the `V$SESSTAT` view. New values are generated after the next session is connected.
Many statistical events are associated with internal implementation, and therefore may be deleted or changed. The actual statistical events shall prevail.

## View statistical events

You can use an SQL statement to display all statistical events and their types in alphabetical order in the `sys` tenant. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT name FROM v$statname ORDER BY name;
```
