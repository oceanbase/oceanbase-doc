<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_PROCESSLIST` view displays information about sessions on all OBServer nodes of the current tenant.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
|----------------|---------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| SVR_IP | varchar(46) | NO | The IP address of the OBServer node. |
| SVR_PORT | bigint(20) | NO | The port number of the OBServer node. |
| SQL_PORT | bigint(20) | NO | The SQL port number. |
| ID | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The ID of the session. |
| USER | varchar(32) | NO | The username. |
| HOST | varchar(128) | NO | The hostname of the client. For example, if you connect to the OBServer node by using an OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), the value is the host address of the ODP. |
| DB | varchar(128) | YES | The name of the database accessed. |
| TENANT | varchar(128) | NO | The name of the tenant accessed. |
| COMMAND | varchar(4096) | NO | The type of the command being executed in the session. |
| TIME | bigint(20) | NO | The execution time of the current command, in seconds. If a retry occurs, the value is cleared and recalculated. |
| TOTAL_TIME | bigint(20) | NO | The total execution time of the current command, in seconds. If a retry occurs, the value will not be cleared. |
| STATE | varchar(128) | YES | The current session status. |
| INFO | varchar(262143) | YES | The command that is being executed. |
| PROXY_SESSID | bigint(20) unsigned | YES | The ODP session ID is displayed if the client is an ODP. |
| MASTER_SESSID | bigint(20) unsigned | YES | The ID of the master session, which is used to concatenate multiple sub-sessions of the same SQL statement. |
| USER_CLIENT_IP | varchar(46) | YES | The IP address of the user client. |
| USER_HOST | varchar(128) | YES | The hostname of the user client. |
| RETRY_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of retries of the current command. |
| RETRY_INFO | bigint(20) | NO | The retry information about the current command. Generally, the value is the error code of the last retry. |
| SQL_ID | varchar(32) | NO | The ID of the SQL statement. |
| TRANS_ID | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The ID of the transaction. |
| THREAD_ID | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The ID of the thread. |
| SSL_CIPHER | varchar(4096) | YES | The encryption password. |
| TRACE_ID | varchar(64) | YES | The trace ID. |
| TRANS_STATE | varchar(32) | YES | The status of the transaction. Valid values:<ul><li>`IDLE`: The transaction is in the idle state, indicating that the transaction is not started. </li> <li>`ACTIVE`: The transaction is explicitly initiated. A transaction can be started explicitly using statements such as `START TRANSACTION` and `BEGIN`. </li> <li>`IMPLICIT_ACTIVE`: The transaction is implicitly initiated. In `autocommit = on` mode, a transaction is initiated after executing DML or other data-modifying statements. </li> <li>`ROLLBACK_SAVEPOINT`: The transaction is rolling back to a savepoint. </li> <li>`IN_TERMINATE`: The transaction is being terminated, including termination due to internal reasons and user-initiated termination (for example, executing the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement). </li> <li>`ABORTED`: The transaction is internally terminated or rolled back due to an exception. </li> <li>`ROLLED_BACK`: The transaction is rolled back. </li> <li>`COMMIT_TIMEOUT`: The transaction commit has timed out. </li> <li>`COMMIT_UNKNOWN`: The transaction commit status is unknown. </li> <li>`COMMITTED`: The transaction is successfully committed. </li></ul> |
| ACTION | varchar(4096) | YES | The name of the operation being executed that is set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION` procedure. |
| MODULE | varchar(4096) | YES | The name of the module that is set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE` procedure. |
| CLIENT_INFO | varchar(4096) | YES | The client information set by the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO` procedure. |
| LEVEL | bigint(20) | NO | The diagnostic information monitoring level for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `1` indicates that level-1 diagnostic information is monitored.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | bigint(20) | NO | The sampling rate for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `50` indicates that diagnostic information is sampled at a rate of 50%.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| RECORD_POLICY | varchar(32) | NO | The diagnostic information recording strategy for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. Three strategies are supported:<ul><li>`ALL`: All sampling-enabled traces that meet specified sampling conditions are recorded in the log file immediately after each span ends.  </li><li>`ONLY_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that meet specified sampling conditions, only traces of slow queries are recorded in the log file, and other traces are discarded. For this strategy, trace logs are recorded after a request ends and is determined as a slow query. In the proxy, the root span, namely the transaction-level span, is immediately recorded when a slow query is detected.  </li><li>`SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that meet specified sampling conditions, those meeting any of the following conditions are recorded in the log file:<ol><li>The hidden parameter <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> is used for sampling at a rate of 0.01% and the sampling result meets specified conditions.</li><li>The condition specified in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy is met.</li></ol>In this mode, the timing for logging varies based on the situation. Specifically, if Condition 1 is met, it is marked on the client that the trace log will be forcibly recorded and this information will be transferred to subsequent components on the link. If Condition 2 is met, the timing for logging is the same as that in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| LB_VID | bigint(20) | YES | The VPC ID of the load balancing service if you directly connect to the database in a public cloud by using the load balancing service. Otherwise, the value is `NULL`.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| LB_VIP | varchar(46) | YES | The IP address used by the client to connect to the load balancing service if you directly connect to the database in a public cloud by using the load balancing service. Otherwise, the value is `NULL`.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| LB_VPORT | bigint(20) | YES | The port used by the client to connect to the load balancing service if you directly connect to the database in a public cloud by using the load balancing service. Otherwise, the value is `NULL`.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| IN_BYTES | bigint(20) | NO | The inbound traffic of the session, in bytes.  <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| OUT_BYTES | bigint(20) | NO | The outbound traffic of the session, in bytes.  <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p></main> |
| TOTAL_CPU_TIME | bigint(21) | NO | The CPU time spent on executing the current statement, in seconds. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.3.1. </p></main> |

## Sample query

Query information about sessions on all OBServer nodes of the current tenant.

```shell
obclient> select * from oceanbase.GV$OB_PROCESSLIST limit 1 \G
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
