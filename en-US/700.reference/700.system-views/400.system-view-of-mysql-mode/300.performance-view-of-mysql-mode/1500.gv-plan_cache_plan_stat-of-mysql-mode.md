# GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The view name is changed from <code>GV$PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> to <code>GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view displays the status of each object cached by the current tenant in the plan cache on all OBServer nodes.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>This view caches both SQL plan objects and Procedural Language (PL) objects (such as anonymous blocks, PL packages, and PL functions). Some columns take effect only for specific objects. </p>
  </main>

| OUTLINE_VERSION | bigint(20) | NO | The version of the outline. |
| OUTLINE_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the outline. The value "-1" indicates that the plan is not generated based on a bound outline. |
