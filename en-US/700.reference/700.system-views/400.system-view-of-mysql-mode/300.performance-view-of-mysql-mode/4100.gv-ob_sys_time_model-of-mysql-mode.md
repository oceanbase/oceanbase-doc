# GV$OB_SYS_TIME_MODEL

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.2. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_SYS_TIME_MODEL` view displays the tenant-level time model statistical items in a cluster.

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
|------------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the tenant. |
| SVR_IP | varchar(46) | NO | The IP address of the OBServer node. |
| SVR_PORT | bigint(20) | NO | The port number of the OBServer node. |
| STAT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the statistical item. |
| STAT_NAME | varchar(64) | NO | The name of the statistical item. |
| VALUE | bigint(20) | NO | The value of the statistical item. |

The following table lists the names and IDs of statistical events in the `STAT_NAME` column.

| Event name | Description | Event ID | Event class |
| ------------|------|------------|----------------|
| DB time | The total amount of active time of the database, which is an accumulative value of the CPU time and non-idle wait time. | 200001 | 3072 |
| DB CPU | The CPU time consumed by the database in the active state. | 200002 | 3072 |
| background elapsed time | The total amount of time spent on background process execution. | 200005 | 3072 |
| background cpu time | The CPU time consumed by background processes. | 200006 | 3072 |
| non idle wait time | The amount of non-idle wait time, namely, the total amount of time elapsed when the session is in the wait but not idle state. | 200010 | 3072 |
| idle wait time | The amount of idle wait time, namely, the total amount of time elapsed when the session is in the idle wait state. | 200011 | 3072 |
| background database time | The total amount of time spent by background processes in executing database operations. | 200012 | 3072 |
| background database non-idle wait time | The amount of time spent by background processes in executing database operations in the non-idle wait state. | 200013 | 3072 |
| background database idle wait time | The amount of time spent by background processes in executing database operations in the idle wait state. | 200014 | 3072 |
| concurrency wait total time | The total amount of wait time caused by concurrency issues, such as the wait time caused by resource locking. | 220001 | 3072 |
| user io wait total time | The total amount of time spent by user processes in waiting for the I/O operations, such as data reads from or data writes to the disk, to complete. | 220002 | 3072 |
| application wait total time | The total amount of wait time caused by the application code, such as lock waits caused by row-level locking or explicit lock commands. | 2200013 | 3072 |

## Sample query

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SYS_TIME_MODEL;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-----------+----------------+----------+---------+-------------------------+------------+
