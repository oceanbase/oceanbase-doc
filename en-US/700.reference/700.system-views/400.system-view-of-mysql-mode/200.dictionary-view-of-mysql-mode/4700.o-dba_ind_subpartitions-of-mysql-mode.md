## Purpose

The `oceanbase.DBA_IND_SUBPARTITIONS` view displays information about all index subpartitions in the database.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

| STATUS | varchar(8) | NO | Indicates whether the index partition is usable. |
| TABLESPACE_NAME | varchar(30) | NO | The name of the tablespace that contains the partition. |
| PCT_FREE | bigint(0) | NO | The minimum percentage of available space in a block. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
