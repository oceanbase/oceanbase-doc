# oceanbase.DBA_TAB_SUBPARTITIONS

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.DBA_TAB_SUBPARTITIONS` view displays, for each subpartition, the subpartition name, the names of the table and partition to which it belongs, its storage attributes, and statistics generated by the `DBMS_STATS` package.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

| INMEMORY | varchar(8) | NO | Indicates whether in-memory column store is enabled for the subpartition. Valid values:<li> `ENABLED`: In-memory column store is enabled.<li>`DISABLED`: In-memory column store is disabled. |
| INMEMORY_PRIORITY | varchar(8) | NO | The padding priority of the in-memory column store. Valid values:<li>LOW<li>MEDIUM<li>HIGH<li>CRITICAL<li>NONE<li>NULL |
| INMEMORY_DISTRIBUTE | varchar(15) | NO | The distribution of in-memory column store in a Real Application Clusters (RAC) environment. Valid values:<li>AUTO<li>BY ROWID RANGE<li>DBY PARTITION<li>BY SUBPARTITION |

The service name is saved in the `INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME` column. |
| INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME | text | NO | The name of the service on which in-memory column store is padded. This column has values only when `INMEMORY_SERVICE` is set to `USER_DEFINED`, and is empty in other cases. |
