| HIGH_VALUE | varchar(128) | NO | The high value in the column. |
| DENSITY | decimal(10,0) | NO | If you can create a histogram on the `COLUMN_NAME` column, this column shows the selectivity of the values with zero or one occurrence in the histogram. It does not represent the selectivity of values with two or more occurrences. If `COLUMN_NAME` is not available on the histogram, the value of this column is 1 or `NUM_DISTINCT`. |
