# GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view displays the statistics about each SQL request on all OBServer nodes, such as the source and execution status. This view is tenant-specific, and only the sys tenant can query this view in other tenants.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>
