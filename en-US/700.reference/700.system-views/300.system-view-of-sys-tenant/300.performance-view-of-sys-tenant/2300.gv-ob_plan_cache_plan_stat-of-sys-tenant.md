# GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The view name is changed from <code>GV$PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> to <code>GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view displays the status of each object cached in the plan cache on all OBServer nodes of all tenants.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>This view caches both SQL plan objects and PL objects (such as anonymous blocks, PL packages, and PL functions). Some columns take effect only for specific objects. </p>
  </main>

| PLAN_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the cached object. |
| SQL_ID | varchar(32) | NO | The SQL ID corresponding to the cached object. If it is a PL object, this column is `NULL`. |
| TYPE | bigint(20) | NO | For SQL plan caching, this column indicates the type of the plan. Valid values:  <ul><li> `1`: indicates a local plan.  </li><li> `2`: indicates a remote plan. </li><li>`3`: indicates a distributed plan.  </li></ul>For PL object caching, this column indicates the type of the PL object. Valid values:<ul><li> `1`: indicates a procedure.    </li><li> `2`: indicates a function. </li><li>`3`: indicates a package.  </li><li> `4`: indicates an anonymous block.   </li></ul> |

| PARAM_INFOS | longtext | NO | The parameter information. |
| SYS_VARS | varchar(4096) | NO | The value of the system variable that affects the plan. |
| CONFIGS | varchar(4096) | NO | The parameters that affect the execution plan. |
| PLAN_HASH | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The hash value of the SQL plan. |
| FIRST_LOAD_TIME | timestamp(6) | NO | The time when the plan was loaded for the first time. |
| SCHEMA_VERSION | bigint(20) | NO | The version of the schema. |
| MERGED_VERSION | bigint(20) | NO | The compaction version corresponding to the current cached plan. |

| AVG_EXE_USEC | bigint(20) | NO | The average execution duration. |
| SLOWEST_EXE_TIME | timestamp(6) | NO | The timestamp of the slowest execution. |
| SLOWEST_EXE_USEC | bigint(20) | NO | The time consumed by the slowest execution. |
| SLOW_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of times that the current SQL plan was identified as a slow query. |
| HIT_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of hits. |
| PLAN_SIZE | bigint(20) | NO | The size of memory occupied by the cached object. |
| EXECUTIONS | bigint(20) | NO | The number of executions. |

| OUTLINE_VERSION | bigint(20) | NO | The version of the outline. |
| OUTLINE_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the outline. The value `-1` indicates that the plan is not generated based on a bound outline. |
| OUTLINE_DATA | longtext | NO | The information about the outline corresponding to the plan. |

| PL_SCHEMA_ID | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | This column is the schema ID of the cached object for PL objects other than anonymous blocks. It is identical to `PS_STMT_ID` for anonymous blocks and meaningless for SQL plans. |
