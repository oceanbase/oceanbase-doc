# V$OB_TENANT_RUNTIME_INFO

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `V$OB_TENANT_RUNTIME_INFO` view displays information about queues and quotas of tenant threads. 

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SVR_IP | varchar(46) | NO | The IP address of the OBServer node. |
| SVR_PORT | bigint(20) | NO | The port number of the OBServer node. |
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the tenant. |
| COMPAT_MODE | bigint(20) | NO | The compatibility mode of the tenant. |
| UNIT_MIN_CPU | double | NO | The minimum number of CPU cores. |
| UNIT_MAX_CPU | double | NO | The maximum number of CPU cores. |
| SLICE | double | NO | The size of slices for resource units of the tenant. |
| REMAIN_SLICE | double | NO | The size of remaining slices. |
| TOKEN_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of tokens allocated by the scheduler. Each token is converted into a worker thread. |
| ASS_TOKEN_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of confirmed tokens in the tenant. You can confirm the number of tokens based on the `token_cnt` parameter. Typically, the values of the two parameters are the same. |
| LQ_TOKENS | bigint(20) | NO | The number of large query tokens. |
| USED_LQ_TOKENS | bigint(20) | NO | The number of worker threads that hold large query tokens. |
| STOPPED | bigint(20) | NO | Indicates whether resource units of the tenant are being deleted. |
| IDLE_US | bigint(20) | NO | The total idle time of the worker threads in one round (10s). The idle time includes only the wait time in queues. |
| RECV_HP_RPC_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of RPC requests of the HP (High) level received by the tenant. |
| RECV_NP_RPC_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of RPC requests of the NP (Normal) level received by the tenant. |
| RECV_LP_RPC_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of RPC requests of the LP (Low) level received by the tenant. |
| RECV_MYSQL_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of MySQL requests received by the tenant. |
| RECV_TASK_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of internal tasks received by the tenant. |
| RECV_LARGE_REQ_CNT | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of large requests predicted by the tenant. The value of this parameter is only incremented but not cleared. The value is incremented upon a retry.  |
| RECV_LARGE_QUERIES | bigint(20) | NO | The cumulative number of large queries received by the tenant. |
| ACTIVES | bigint(20) | NO | The number of active worker threads, which is often the same as the value of the `WORKERS` parameter. The difference between the values of the two parameters results from the cached worker threads and the cached large requests with worker threads. |
| WORKERS | bigint(20) | NO | The number of worker threads held by the tenant, which equals the size of the workers_list.  |
| LQ_WAITING_WORKERS | bigint(20) | NO | The number of worker threads waiting for large queries. |
| REQ_QUEUE_TOTAL_SIZE | bigint(20) | NO | The total size of request queues. |
| QUEUE_0 | bigint(20) | NO | The size of Queue 0. |
| QUEUE_1 | bigint(20) | NO | The size of Queue 1. |
| QUEUE_2 | bigint(20) | NO | The size of Queue 2. |
| QUEUE_3 | bigint(20) | NO | The size of Queue 3. |
| QUEUE_4 | bigint(20) | NO | The size of Queue 4. |
| QUEUE_5 | bigint(20) | NO | The size of Queue 5. |
| LARGE_QUEUED | bigint(20) | NO | The number of queuing large queries. |
