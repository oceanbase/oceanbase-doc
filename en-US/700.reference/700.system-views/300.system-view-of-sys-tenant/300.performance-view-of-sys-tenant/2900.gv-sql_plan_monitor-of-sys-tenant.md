# GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR

## Purpose

The `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view displays plan-level statistics about slow queries on all OBServer nodes. Each slow query has one row in this view. It also records the trace information about the plan.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V1.4. </p>
