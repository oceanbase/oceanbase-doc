# oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view displays the ongoing load balancing jobs of all tenants. Each tenant can have only one running load balancing job at a time. A load balancing job generates multiple load balancing tasks for specific load balancing operations. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.0. </p>
