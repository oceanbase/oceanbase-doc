# oceanbase.DBA_IND_SUBPARTITIONS

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.DBA_IND_SUBPARTITIONS` view provides information about all index subpartitions in the database.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

| SUBPARTITION_NAME | varchar(128) | NO | The name of the subpartition. |
| HIGH_VALUE | mediumtext | NO | The expression for the value bound with the subpartition. |
| HIGH_VALUE_LENGTH | bigint(20) | NO | The length of the expression for the value bound with the subpartition. |
| PARTITION_POSITION | bigint(20) | NO | The position of the partition within the index. |

| STATUS | varchar(8) | NO | Indicates whether the index partition is usable. |
| TABLESPACE_NAME | varchar(30) | NO | The name of the tablespace that contains the partition. |
| PCT_FREE | bigint(0) | NO | The minimum percentage of available space in a block. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |

| MAX_TRANS | bigint(0) | NO | The maximum number of transactions. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| INITIAL_EXTENT | bigint(0) | NO | The size of the initial extent, in the unit of bytes. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| NEXT_EXTENT | bigint(0) | NO | The size of secondary extents, in the unit of bytes. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |

| MAX_SIZE | bigint(0) | NO | The maximum number of blocks allowed in the segment. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| PCT_INCREASE | bigint(0) | NO | The percentage increase in the extent size. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| FREELISTS | bigint(0) | NO | The number of process freelists that are allocated in the segment. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
