# oceanbase.DBA_TAB_PARTITIONS

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.DBA_TAB_PARTITIONS` view displays the multi-level partitioning information, partition storage parameters, and partition statistics accessible to the current user.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>
