# oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_TASKS

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_TASKS` view displays backup tasks of all tenants in the cluster. A task record is generated for each backup set. The task records and job records are in one-to-one mapping.

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| TENANT_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the tenant. |
| TASK_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the backup task, which corresponds to a backup set. |
| JOB_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The job ID of the backup task. |
| INCARNATION | bigint(20) | NO | The nth incarnation of the database after the Flashback Database operation. |
| BACKUP_SET_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the backup set that corresponds to the backup task. |
| START_TIMESTAMP | timestamp(6) | NO | The start time of the backup task. |
| END_TIMESTAMP | timestamp(6) | NO | The time when the backup task ended. |
| STATUS | varchar(4096) | NO | The backup status. |
| START_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The SCN at which the backup starts. |
| END_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The SCN at which the backup ends. |
| USER_LS_START_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The SCN of the metadata of the backup log stream. |
| ENCRYPTION_MODE | varchar(4096) | YES | The encryption mode. Valid values: <br>`None`: indicates that encryption is not implemented.<br>`Password`: indicates that only the password is used for protection.<br>`Password Encryption`: indicates that encryption is implemented and the password is used for protection.<br>`Transparent Encryption`: indicates that TDE is used for encryption.<br>`Dual Mode Encryption`: indicates that TDE encryption is implemented and the password is used for protection.<br>Currently, only the `None` and `Password` modes are supported. |
| PASSWD | varchar(4096) | YES | The password. |
| INPUT_BYTES | bigint(20) | YES | The number of input bytes. |
| OUTPUT_BYTES | bigint(20) | YES | The number of output bytes. |
| OUTPUT_RATE_BYTES | decimal(28,4) | NO | The number of bytes that are output per second. |
| EXTRA_META_BYTES | bigint(20) | YES | The number of extra bytes. |
| TABLET_COUNT | bigint(20) | YES | The total number of tablets. |
| FINISH_TABLET_COUNT | bigint(20) | YES | The total number of tablets backed up. |
| MACRO_BLOCK_COUNT | bigint(20) | YES | The number of macroblocks. |
| FINISH_MACRO_BLOCK_COUNT | bigint(20) | YES | The number of macroblocks backed up. |
| FILE_COUNT | bigint(20) | YES | The number of backup files. |
| META_TURN_ID | bigint(20) | YES | The round of metadata backup. |
| DATA_TURN_ID | bigint(20) | YES | The round of data backup. |
| RESULT | bigint(20) | YES | The returned backup error code. |
| COMMENT | varchar(4096) | YES | The description of the error code. |
| PATH | varchar(4096) | YES | The backup path. |
| MINOR_TURN_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the round at which the backup of minor compaction data ended. |
| MAJOR_TURN_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the round at which the backup of baseline data ended. |
| DATA_PROGRESS | DECIMAL(26,2) | NO | The data backup progress, which is calculated by using the following formula: `Number of macro blocks that have been backed up/Total number of macroblocks`. The value is rounded off to the second decimal place. For example, the value `87.65` indicates that the current progress is 87.65%.  |
| LOG_FILE_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The total number of archived clog files. |
| FINISH_LOG_FILE_COUNT | bigint(20) | NO | The number of archived clog files that have been backed up. |
| LOG_PROGRESS | DECIMAL(26,2) | NO | The backup progress of archived clog files, which is calculated by using the following formula: `Number of archived clog files that have been backed up/Total number of archived clog files`. The value is rounded off to the second decimal place. For example, the value `87.65` indicates that the current progress is 87.65%.  |

## Sample query

Query backup tasks of all tenants in the cluster from the sys tenant.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_TASKS\G
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
