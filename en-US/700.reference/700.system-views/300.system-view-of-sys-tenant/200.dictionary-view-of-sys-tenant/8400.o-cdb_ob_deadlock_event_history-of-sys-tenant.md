# oceanbase.CDB_OB_DEADLOCK_EVENT_HISTORY

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.CDB_OB_DEADLOCK_EVENT_HISTORY` view displays the history of deadlock events. After you log on as the root user to the sys tenant, you can view the deadlock event history of all tenants.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

| SVR_PORT | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The port number on the node participating in the deadlock event. |
| DETECTOR_ID | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The ID of the node participating in the deadlock event, which must be unique within the process. |
| REPORT_TIME | timestamp(6) | NO | The reporting time of the deadlock event based on the timestamp on the reporting server. |
