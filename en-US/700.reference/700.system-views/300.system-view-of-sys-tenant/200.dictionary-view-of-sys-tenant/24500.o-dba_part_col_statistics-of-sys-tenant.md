| HIGH_VALUE | varchar(128) | NO | The high value in the column. |
| DENSITY | decimal(10,0) | NO | If you can create a histogram on the `COLUMN_NAME` column, this column shows the selectivity of the values with zero or one occurrence in the histogram. It does not represent the selectivity of values with two or more occurrences. If `COLUMN_NAME` is not available on the histogram, the value of this column is `1` or `NUM_DISTINCT`. |
| NUM_NULLS | decimal(10,0) | NO | The number of `NULLs` in the column. |

Valid values:<li>`INCREMENTAL`: indicates that the column has a summary.<li>`INCREMENTAL(HLL)`: indicates that the column has a summary in the HyperLogLog (HLL) format.<li>`INCREMENTAL(SAMPLING)`: indicates that the column has a summary in an adaptive sampling format. <br>You can check this column to determine whether the summary of the adaptive sampling format has been completely eliminated and properly cleared. |
| AVG_COL_LEN | decimal(10,0) | NO | The average column length, in bytes. |
