# oceanbase.DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG_PIECE_FILES

## Purpose

The `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG_PIECE_FILES` view displays the status of backup pieces in each backup set.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEST_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The path ID. The system allocates a unique ID to each specified path. |
| ROUND_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The Nth complete clog backup data flow. |
| PIECE_ID | bigint(20) | NO | The ID of the log backup piece. |
| INCARNATION | bigint(20) | NO | The Nth incarnation of the database after the Flashback Database operation. |
| DEST_NO | bigint(20) | NO | The log archive destination number. For example, the destination number of `log_archive_dest` is 0, and that of `log_archive_dest_1` is 1. |
| CREATE_TIMESTAMP | bigint(20) | NO | The time when a piece was created. |
| STATUS | varchar(64) | NO | The status of the piece. Valid values: <br>`ACTIVE`: The piece is active.<br>`FREEZING`: The piece is being frozen.<br>`FROZEN`: The piece is frozen. The status of a frozen piece will no longer change. |
| BASE_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The theoretical start checkpoint of the piece. For the first piece, `BASE_SCN` is unequal to `START_SCN`. For other pieces, `BASE_SCN` is equal to `START_SCN`. |
| START_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The actual start checkpoint of the piece. |
| START_SCN_DISPLAY | datetime(6) | NO | The value of `START_SCN` after being converted into the unit of time. |
| CHECKPOINT_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The current archive checkpoint. |
| CHECKPOINT_SCN_DISPLAY | datetime(6) | NO | The value of `CHECKPOINT_SCN` after being converted into the unit of time. |
| MAX_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The maximum archive checkpoint. |
| END_SCN | bigint(20) unsigned | NO | The theoretical end checkpoint of the piece. |
| END_SCN_DISPLAY | datetime(6) | NO | The end time of the piece. |
| COMPATIBLE | bigint(20) | NO | The version number compatible with log archiving. |
| UNIT_SIZE | bigint(20) | NO | The size of the log block into which archived log data is compressed or encrypted. At present, this column is not supported. |
| COMPRESSION | varchar(128) | NO | The compression algorithm. Valid values:<ul><li> `none`: indicates that the archived log data is not compressed. </li><li> `lz4_1.0`: indicates that the `lz4_1.0` compression algorithm is used to compress the archived log data. </li><li>`zstd_1.3.8`: indicates that the `zstd_1.3.8` compression algorithm is used to compress the archived log data.</li></ul>At present, this column is not supported. |
| INPUT_BYTES | bigint(20) | NO | The volume of raw data. |
| INPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY | varchar(27) | NO | The value of `INPUT_BYTES` after unit conversion. |
| OUTPUT_BYTES | bigint(20) | NO | The data volume after encryption and compression. |
| OUTPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY | varchar(27) | NO | The value of `OUTPUT_BYTES` after unit conversion. |
| COMPRESSION_RATIO | decimal(23,2) | NO | The compression ratio. |
| FILE_STATUS | varchar(64) | NO | The file status of the backup piece. Valid values:<br>`AVAILABLE`: indicates a valid backup that can be used for restore.<br>`COPYING`: indicates that the log file is being backed up.<br>`INCOMPLETE`: The logs in the piece are incomplete, and the logs of some log streams are missing.<br>`DELETING`: indicates that the log file is being deleted.<br>`EXPIRED`: indicates that the backup file has expired.<br>`BROKEN`: indicates that the backup file is incomplete and cannot be used.<br>`DELETED`: indicates that the log file has been deleted. |
| PATH | varchar(2048) | NO | The archive path. |
