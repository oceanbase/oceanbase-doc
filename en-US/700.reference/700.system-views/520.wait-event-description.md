# General wait events

## Overview

The information about wait events is displayed in the following dynamic performance views:

* `V$SESSION_WAIT`: displays the current or last wait events of sessions.
* `V$SYSTEM_EVENT`: displays all wait events of the current tenant.
* `V$SESSION_EVENT`: displays all wait events for each session. This view is similar to `V$SYSTEM_EVENT`.

Many wait events are associated with internal implementation, and therefore may be deleted or changed. The actual wait events shall prevail.

## Wait event classes

Each wait event belongs to a specific class of wait event. Wait events are classified into the following classes:

* Administrative
   User wait events caused by a DBA command, such as index rebuilding.
* Application
   Wait events caused by user application code, such as a lock wait event caused by a row lock or by an explicit lock command.
* Cluster
   Wait events associated with cluster resources, such as the "gc cr block busy" event and other events related to global cache resources.
* Commit
   This class contains only one wait event, which is the event of waiting for the confirmation of Redo log writes upon commit, where the confirmation is also known as "log file synchronization".
* Concurrency
   Events of waiting for internal database resources, such as latches.
* Configuration
   Wait events caused by insufficient database or instance resource specifications, such as insufficient log file size or shared pool size.
* Idle
   Wait events that indicate the inactive status of a session, such as "SQL*Net message from client".
* Network
   Wait events associated with network messaging, such as "SQL*Net more data to dblink".
* Other
   Unexpected wait events in the system, such as "waiting for EMON generation".
* Queueing
   Delay events caused by the obtaining of additional data in a pipeline environment. A long time consumed by these events indicates the inefficiency or other problems of the pipeline. They affect features such as parallel queries and DBMS_PIPE PL/SQL packages.
* Scheduler
   Wait events associated with the resource manager, such as 'resmgr: become active'.
* System I/O
   Events of waiting for background process I/O resources, such as DBWR waits for 'db file parallel write'.
* User I/O
   Events of waiting for user I/O resources, such as "db file sequential read".

## View wait events

You can execute SQL statements under the system tenant to display all wait events and their classes in alphabetical order. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT name, wait_class FROM V$EVENT_NAME ORDER BY name;
```
