# General wait events

## Overview

The information about wait events is displayed in the following dynamic performance views:

* `V$SESSION_WAIT`: displays the current or last wait events of sessions.
* `V$SYSTEM_EVENT`: displays all wait events of the current tenant.
* `V$SESSION_EVENT`: displays all wait events for each session. This view is similar to `V$SYSTEM_EVENT`.

Many wait events are associated with internal implementation, and therefore may be deleted or changed. The actual wait events shall prevail.

## Wait event classes

Each wait event belongs to a specific class of wait event. Wait events are classified into the following classes:

| Event class | Event class ID | Description |
| ------------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| OTHER | 100 | A wait event that does not belong to any other classes. |
| APPLICATION | 101 | A wait event caused by the client code. |
| CONFIGURATION | 102 | A wait event caused by insufficient resources configured for the database or instance. |
| ADMINISTRATIVE | 103 | A wait event caused by a command entered by the database administrator (DBA). |
| CONCURRENCY | 104 | A wait event of waiting for internal resources of the database. |
| COMMIT | 105 | A wait event related to log commitment. |
| IDLE | 106 | A task execution wait event when the session is inactive. |
| NETWORK | 107 | A wait event related to network communication. |
| USER_IO | 108 | A user I/O wait event. |
| SYSTEM_IO | 109 | A wait event of waiting for background process I/O resources. |
| CLUSTER | 111 | A wait event related to clusters. |

## View wait events

You can execute SQL statements under the `sys` tenant to display all wait events and their classes in alphabetical order. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT name, wait_class FROM V$EVENT_NAME ORDER BY name;
```
