# V$OB_SQL_PLAN

## Purpose

The `V$OB_SQL_PLAN` view displays the plan information collected by executing the `EXPLAIN PLAN` statement. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.0. </p>
</main>

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DB_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the execution plan. |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The query ID. |
| PLAN_HASH | NUMBER(38) | NO | The schema ID of the query. |
| PLAN_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The hash value of the plan. |
| GMT_CREATE | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The time when the record was generated. |
| OPERATOR | VARCHAR2(255) | NO | The name of the operator, such as `TABLE SCAN` and `SORT`. |
| OBJECT_NODE | VARCHAR2(40) | NO | The object node. The value is the name of the DBLink if the current operator is related to DBLinks. |
| OBJECT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the scanned object, such as the ID of a physical table scanned by the TABLE SCAN operator. |
| OBJECT_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The user of the scanned object. |
| OBJECT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the scanned object, such as the name of a physical table scanned by the TABLE SCAN operator. |
| OBJECT_ALIAS | VARCHAR2(261) | NO | The alias of the scanned object, such as the alias of a physical table scanned by the TABLE SCAN operator. |
| OBJECT_TYPE | VARCHAR2(20) | NO | The type of the scanned object, such as `SYNONYM`, `DBLINK`, and `BASIC TABLE`. |
| OPTIMIZER | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The index information, such as the physical row, logical row, number of rows returned for a table access by index primary key, type of the statistical information, and version number of the statistical information. |
| ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the logical operator. |
| PARENT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the parent operator of the logical operator. |
| DEPTH | NUMBER(38) | NO | The depth of the logical operator in the current plan, or the layer of the logical operator in the binary plan tree. |
| POSITION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The position of the current logical operator in a series of child operators of its parent operator. |
| COST | NUMBER(38) | NO | The cost estimated by the optimizer. |
| REAL_COST | NUMBER(38) | NO | The actual cost in executing the plan for the first time. This information is returned in the execution feedback. |
| CARDINALITY | NUMBER(38) | NO | The estimated number of rows returned for the current operator. This value is calculated by the optimizer. |
| REAL_CARDINALITY | NUMBER(38) | NO | The actual number of rows returned for the current operator during the first execution of the plan. This information is returned in the execution feedback. |
| IO_COST | NUMBER(38) | NO | The actual I/O cost of the current operator during the first execution of the plan. This information is returned in execution feedback. |
| CPU_COST | NUMBER(38) | NO | The actual CPU cost of the current operator during the first execution of the plan. This information is returned in execution feedback. |
| BYTES | NUMBER(38) | NO | The estimated data width of the current operator. This value is calculated by the optimizer. |
| ROWSET | NUMBER(38) | NO | The vector size of the current operator. |
| OTHER_TAG | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The hints that have been used by the current query. This information is stored only in the first line of the plan. |
| PARTITION_START | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The partition scanned by the TABLE SCAN operator. |
| OTHER | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The optimization information, such as the plan type, parameterized information about the fast parser, plan note, and constraint information about the plan that is hit. |
| ACCESS_PREDICATES | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The expression to be accessed by the current operator. |
| FILTER_PREDICATES | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The filter condition of the current operator. |
| STARTUP_PREDICATES | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The condition for starting the current operator. |
| PROJECTION | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The output expression of the current operator. |
| SPECIAL_PREDICATES | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The special expression of the current operator, such as `Join Condition`, `GROUP EXPRS`, and `SORT EXPRS`. |
| QBLOCK_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the query block where the current operator resides. |
| REMARKS | VARCHAR2(4000) | NO | The modification tracking information about the query block. |
