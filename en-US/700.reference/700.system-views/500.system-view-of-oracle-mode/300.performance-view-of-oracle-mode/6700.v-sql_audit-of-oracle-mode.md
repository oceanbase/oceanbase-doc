# V$OB_SQL_AUDIT

## **Purpose**

The `V$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view displays statistics about each SQL request on the current OBServer node, such as the source and execution status of the request. This view is tenant-specific, and only the sys tenant can query this view in other tenants.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>
