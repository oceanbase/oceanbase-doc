# GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_FLT_TRACE_CONFIG` view displays information about end-to-end diagnostics. 

## Columns

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the tenant. </li><li>Other values: a user tenant or meta tenant. </li></ul> |
| TYPE | VARCHAR2(16) | NO | The monitoring level of the diagnostics information. Valid values:  </li><li>Module/Action level: Diagnostics are monitored based on modules and actions. </li><li>Client identifier level: Diagnostics are monitored based on client identifiers. </li></ul> |
| TENANT_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the tenant. |
| MODULE_NAME | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The name of the module. |
| ACTION_NAME | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The name of the action. |
| CLIENT_IDENTIFIER | VARCHAR2(65) | NO | The client identifier. |
| LEVEL | NUMBER(38) | NO | The diagnostic information monitoring level for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `1` indicates that level-1 diagnostic information is monitored. |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The sampling rate for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `50` indicates that diagnostic information is sampled at a rate of 50%. |
| RECORD_POLICY | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The diagnostic information recording strategy for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. Three strategies are supported:<ul><li>`ALL`: All sampling-enabled traces that meet specified sampling conditions are recorded in the log file immediately after each span ends.  </li><li>`ONLY_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that meet specified sampling conditions, only traces of slow queries are recorded in the log file, and other traces are discarded. For this strategy, trace logs are recorded after a request ends and is determined as a slow query. In the proxy, the root span, namely the transaction-level span, is immediately recorded when a slow query is detected.  </li><li>`SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that meet specified sampling conditions, those meeting any of the following conditions are recorded in the log file:<ol><li>The hidden parameter <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> is used for sampling at a rate of 0.01% and the sampling result meets specified conditions.</li><li>The condition specified in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy is met.</li></ol>In this mode, the timing for logging varies based on the situation. Specifically, if Condition 1 is met, it is marked on the client that the trace log will be forcibly recorded and this information will be transferred to subsequent components on the link. If Condition 2 is met, the timing for logging is the same as that in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy. </li></ul> |
