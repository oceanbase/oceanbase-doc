# V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The view name is changed from <code>V$PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> to <code>V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT</code> since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Purpose

The `V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view displays the status of each object cached in the plan cache on the current OBServer node of the current tenant.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>This view caches both SQL plan objects and PL objects (such as anonymous blocks, PL packages, and PL functions). Some columns take effect only for specific objects. </p>
  </main>

| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | NO | The IP address of the OBServer node. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The port number of the OBServer node. |
| PLAN_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the cached object. |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The SQL ID corresponding to the cached object. If it is a PL object, this column is `NULL`. |
| TYPE | NUMBER(38) | NO | For SQL plan caching, this column indicates the type of the plan. Valid values:  <ul><li> `1`: indicates a local plan.  </li><li> `2`: indicates a remote plan. </li><li>`3`: indicates a distributed plan.  </li></ul>For PL object caching, this column indicates the type of the PL object. Valid values:<ul><li> `1`: indicates a procedure.    </li><li> `2`: indicates a function. </li><li>`3`: indicates a package.  </li><li> `4`: indicates an anonymous block.   </li></ul> |

| DB_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the database. |
| STATEMENT | CLOB | NO | If the cached object is an SQL plan, the column is a parameterized SQL statement. If the cached object is an anonymous block, the column is a parameterized anonymous block statement. This column is invalid for other types of objects. |
| QUERY_SQL | CLOB | NO | If the cached object is an SQL plan, the column is the original SQL statement queried when the plan was loaded for the first time. If the cached object is an anonymous block, the column is a parameterized anonymous block statement. |
| SPECIAL_PARAMS | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The values of parameters that cannot be parameterized. |
| PARAM_INFOS | CLOB | NO | The parameter information. |
| SYS_VARS | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The values of system variables that affect the cached object. |
| PLAN_HASH | NUMBER(38) | NO | The hash value of the SQL plan. |
| FIRST_LOAD_TIME | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The time when the plan was loaded for the first time. |
| SCHEMA_VERSION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The version of the schema. |
| MERGED_VERSION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The compaction version corresponding to the current cached plan. |
| LAST_ACTIVE_TIME | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The time of the last execution. |
| AVG_EXE_USEC | NUMBER(38) | NO | The average execution duration. |
| SLOWEST_EXE_TIME | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The timestamp of the slowest execution. |
| SLOWEST_EXE_USEC | NUMBER(38) | NO | The time consumed by the slowest execution. |
| SLOW_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of times that the current SQL plan was identified as a slow query. |
| HIT_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of hits. |
| PLAN_SIZE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The size of memory occupied by the cached object. |
| EXECUTIONS | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of executions. |
| DISK_READS | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total number of physical reads of all executions. |
| DIRECT_WRITES | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total number of disk writes of all executions. |
| BUFFERS_GETS | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total number of logical reads of all executions. |
| APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total amount of time spent on all wait events of the application class during all executions. |
| CONCURRENCY_WAIT_TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total amount of time spent on all wait events of the concurrency class during all executions. |
| USER_IO_WAIT_TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total amount of time spent on all wait events of the user I/O class during all executions. |
| ROWS_PROCESSED | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total number of rows in the results selected for all executions or the number of rows modified by executing the ALTER TABLE statement. |
| ELAPSED_TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total time consumed by all executions, where the time consumed by each execution is defined as the time elapsed from when the execution request was received to when the execution was completed. |
| CPU_TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total amount of CPU time used by all executions. |
| LARGE_QUERYS | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of times the cached object was considered a large query. |
| DELAYED_LARGE_QUERYS | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of times the cached object was considered a large query and dropped to the large query queue. |
| DELAYED_PX_QUERYS | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of times a subquery in a parallel query was dropped back into the queue for retry. |
| OUTLINE_VERSION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The version of the outline. |
| OUTLINE_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the outline. The value `-1` indicates that the plan is not generated based on a bound outline. |
| OUTLINE_DATA | CLOB | NO | The information about the outline corresponding to the plan. |
| HINTS_INFO | CLOB | NO | The hints of the SQL plan. |
| HINTS_ALL_WORKED | NUMBER(38) | NO | Indicates whether all the hints in the SQL plan have taken effect. |

Valid values: <li> `-1`: indicates that the PS protocol is not used in the SQL statement.   <li> Value other than `-1`: indicates that the PS protocol is used in the SQL statement. It also indicates the unique identifier returned by the PS protocol for the statement. |
| SESSID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the session containing the cached object. |

| PL_SCHEMA_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | This column is the schema ID of the cached object for PL objects other than anonymous blocks. It is identical to `PS_STMT_ID` for anonymous blocks and meaningless for SQL plans. |
| IS_BATCHED_MULTI_STMT | NUMBER(38) | NO | Indicates whether the plan has been optimized for batch execution of multiple statements. |
