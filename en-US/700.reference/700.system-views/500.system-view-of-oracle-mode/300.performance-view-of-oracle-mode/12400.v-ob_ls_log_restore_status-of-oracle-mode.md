| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TENANT_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the tenant. |
| LS_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the log stream. |
| SYNC_LSN | NUMBER(38) | NO | The LSN of the maximum consecutive majority checkpoint of the standby database, also known as the maximum consumption checkpoint. |
| SYNC_SCN | NUMBER(38) | NO | The SCN of the maximum consecutive majority checkpoint of the standby database, also known as the maximum consumption checkpoint. |

Valid values: <ul><li>`NORMAL`: Logs are synchronized properly.  </li><li>`SOURCE HAS A GAP`: The log source has a gap in logs. </li><li>`STANDBY LOG NOT MATCH`: A restored log conflicts with a log in the standby database. For example, a log in the standby database is different from the log that has the same LSN in the log source.  </li><li>`CHECK USER OR PASSWORD`: The log source cannot be accessed because the copied username or password of the account is incorrect.  </li><li>`CHECK NETWORK`: The log source is unreachable because an incorrect access IP address or port number is specified for the tenant.  </li><li>`FETCH LOG TIMEOUT`: A log pull task timed out.  </li><li>`RESTORE SUSPEND`: Logs have been synchronized to the specified maximum synchronization timestamp.  </li><li>`STANDBY NEED UPGRADE`: The version of the standby database is earlier than that of the primary database, and must be upgraded.  </li><li>`CHECK PRIMARY ALIVE`: The primary database cannot be accessed. In this case, check whether the primary database has been deleted.  </li><li> `NOT AVAILABLE`: Log synchronization is unavailable due to other exceptions. </li></ul> |
