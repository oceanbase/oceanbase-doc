## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
|----------------|------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | NO | The IP address of the server. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The port number of the server. |
| SQL_PORT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The SQL port number. |
| ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The session ID. |
| USER | CHAR(193) | NO | The username. |
| HOST | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The hostname of the client. For example, if you connect to the OBServer node through OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), the value is the host address of ODP. |
| DB | VARCHAR2(128) | YES | The name of the database accessed. |
| TENANT | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the tenant accessed. |
| COMMAND | VARCHAR2(4096) | NO | The type of the command being executed in the session. |
| TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The execution time of the current command, in seconds. If a retry occurs, the value is cleared and recalculated. |
| TOTAL_TIME | NUMBER(38) | NO | The total execution time of the current command, in seconds. If a retry occurs, the value will not be cleared. |
| STATE | VARCHAR2(128) | YES | The current session status. |
| INFO | VARCHAR2(262143) | YES | The command that is being executed. |
| PROXY_SESSID | NUMBER(38) | YES | The ODP session ID is displayed if the client is an ODP. |
| MASTER_SESSID | NUMBER(38) | YES | The ID of the master session, which is used to concatenate multiple sub-sessions of the same SQL statement. |
| USER_CLIENT_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | YES | The IP address of the user client. |
| USER_HOST | VARCHAR2(128) | YES | The hostname of the user client. |
| RETRY_CNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of retries of the current command. |
| RETRY_INFO | NUMBER(38) | NO | The retry information about the current command. Generally, the value is the error code of the last retry. |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The ID of the SQL statement. |
| TRANS_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The transaction ID. |
| THREAD_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The thread ID. |
| SSL_CIPHER | VARCHAR2(4096) | YES | The encryption password. |
| TRACE_ID | VARCHAR2(64) | YES | The trace ID. |
| TRANS_STATE | VARCHAR2(32) | YES | The transaction status. |
| ACTION | VARCHAR2(4096) | YES | The name of the operation being executed that is set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_ACTION` procedure. |
| MODULE | VARCHAR2(4096) | YES | The name of the module that is set by calling the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_MODULE` procedure. |
| CLIENT_INFO | VARCHAR2(4096) | YES | The client information set by the `DBMS_APPLICATION_INFO.SET_CLIENT_INFO` procedure. |
| LEVEL | NUMBER(38) | NO | The monitoring level of end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `1` indicates level-1 diagnostics.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1.</p></main> |
| SAMPLE_PERCENTAGE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The sampling frequency for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. For example, the value `50` indicates that diagnostics are sampled at the frequency of 50%.<main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1.</p></main> |
| RECORD_POLICY | VARCHAR2(32) | NO | The recording strategy for end-to-end diagnostics of the session. Three strategies are supported:<ul><li>`ALL`: All sampling-enabled traces that are hit are recorded in the log file immediately after each span ends.  </li><li>`ONLY_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that are hit, only traces of slow queries are recorded in the log file, and other traces are discarded. For this strategy, trace logs are recorded after a request ends and is determined as a slow query. In the proxy, the root span (transaction-level span) is immediately recorded when a slow query is detected.  </li><li>`SAMPLE_AND_SLOW_QUERY`: Among sampling-enabled traces that are hit, those meeting any of the following conditions are recorded in the log file:<ol><li>The hidden parameter <code>_print_sample_ppm</code> is used for sampling at a frequency of 0.01% and the sampling result is hit.</li><li>The condition specified in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy is met.</li></ol>In this mode, the logging time varies based on the situation. Specifically, if Condition 1 is met, it is marked on the client that the trace log will be forcibly recorded and this information will be transferred to subsequent components on the link. If Condition 2 is met, the logging time is the same as that in the `ONLY_SLOW_QUERY` strategy. </li></ul><main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>This column is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.2.1.</p></main> |
