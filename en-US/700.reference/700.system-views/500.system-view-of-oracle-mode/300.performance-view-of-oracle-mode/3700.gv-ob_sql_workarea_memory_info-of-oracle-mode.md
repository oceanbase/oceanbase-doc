# GV$OB_SQL_WORKAREA_MEMORY_INFO

## Purpose

The `GV$OB_SQL_WORKAREA_MEMORY_INFO` view displays some general information about the SQL workarea, including the maximum available memory, current memory usage, and currently held memory. In this view, you can learn about the usage of the workareas in the current tenant, such as the memory usage.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V2.2.77. </p>

## **Columns**

| **Column** | **Type** | **Nullable?** | **Description** |
|------------------------|------------|----------------|----------|
| MAX_WORKAREA_SIZE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The maximum memory that the workarea can occupy. The available memory is determined by `ob_sql_work_area_percentage`. |
| WORKAREA_HOLD_SIZE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The size of the currently held memory of the workarea.<br>**Note**<br> Only the size of the held memory can be obtained because the specific usage cannot be obtained from the memory management module.  |
| MAX_AUTO_WORKAREA_SIZE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The estimated maximum available memory size in auto mode. The maximum available memory is calculated based on the following formula: `MAX_WORKAREA_SIZE â€“ WORKAREA_HOLD_SIZE + TOTAL_MEM_USED`. It indicates the maximum memory that is automatically managed in the current workarea. |
| MEM_TARGET | NUMBER(38) | NO | The target size of memory that the workarea can occupy. It differs from `MAX_AUTO_WORKAREA_SIZE` in that this size is part of the maximum available size in auto mode. |
| TOTAL_MEM_USED | NUMBER(38) | NO | The size of memory used in auto mode. This size is obtained by the automatic memory management module and does not reflect the actual used size. |
| GLOBAL_MEM_BOUND | NUMBER(38) | NO | The maximum available global memory in auto mode. |
| DRIFT_SIZE | NUMBER(38) | NO | The current change in the required memory size. When the value of this column reaches the specified threshold, the global bound size is automatically recalculated. |
| WORKAREA_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of registered operator profiles. |
| MANUAL_CALC_COUNT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The number of calculations of the global bound size that are irregularly triggered. |
| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | NO | The IP address of the OBServer node. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER | NO | The port number of the OBServer node. |
