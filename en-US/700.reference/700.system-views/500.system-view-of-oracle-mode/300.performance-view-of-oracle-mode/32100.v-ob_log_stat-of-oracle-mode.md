# V$OB_LOG_STAT

## Purpose

The `V$OB_LOG_STAT` view displays the Palf status of log streams. You can use this view to perform the following operations:

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

1. Query whether a log stream has a leader and the replica of the leader.
2. Query the member list, that is, the number of Paxos replicas, of a log stream.
3. Query the replica synchronization status.
4. Query the recyclable checkpoint of the logs of a log stream.
5. Query the log consumption service scope of a log stream based on the log sequence number (LSN) or system change number (SCN).
6. Query the access mode of Palf.

The query results vary based on the tenant.

* When you query this view from a sys tenant, the Palf status of all tenant log streams is displayed.
* When you query this view from a user tenant, only the Palf status of the log streams of the current tenant is displayed.
