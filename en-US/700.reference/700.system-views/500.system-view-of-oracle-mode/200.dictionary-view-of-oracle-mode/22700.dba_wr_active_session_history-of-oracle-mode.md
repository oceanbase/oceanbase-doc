| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(46) | NO | The IP address of the OBServer node. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER(38) | NO | The port number of the OBServer node. |
| SAMPLE_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the sample. |
| SESSION_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The ID of the sampled session. |
| SAMPLE_TIME | TIMESTAMP(6) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | NO | The sampling time. |

Valid values: <ul><li>`EVENT_NO == 0`: `ON CPU` indicates that the SQL logic is being executed without waiting.  </li><li>`EVENT_NO ≠ 0`: "WATITING" indicates that the session is waiting. The wait details are provided in the `EVENT` column. </li></ul> |

| TRACE_ID | VARCHAR2(64) | YES | TRACE_ID |
| EVENT_NO | NUMBER(38) | YES | The internal number of the wait event, which is used for join query with other tables. |
| TIME_WAITED | NUMBER(38) | YES | The total wait time of the wait event, in μs. |
| P1 | NUMBER(38) | YES | The value of the first parameter of the wait event. |
