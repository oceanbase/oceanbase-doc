| STATUS | VARCHAR2(8) | NO | Indicates whether the index partition is usable. |
| TABLESPACE_NAME | VARCHAR2(30) | NO | The name of the tablespace that contains the partition. |
| PCT_FREE | NUMBER | NO | The minimum percentage of available space in a block. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| INI_TRANS | NUMBER | NO | The initial number of transactions. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| MAX_TRANS | NUMBER | NO | The maximum number of transactions. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| INITIAL_EXTENT | NUMBER | NO | The size of the initial extent, in the unit of bytes. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| NEXT_EXTENT | NUMBER | NO | The size of secondary extents, in the unit of bytes. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| MIN_EXTENT | NUMBER | NO | The minimum number of extents allowed in the segment. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |

| MAX_SIZE | NUMBER | NO | The maximum number of blocks allowed in the segment. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
| PCT_INCREASE | NUMBER | NO | The percentage increase in the extent size. At present, this column is not supported and is `NULL` by default. |
