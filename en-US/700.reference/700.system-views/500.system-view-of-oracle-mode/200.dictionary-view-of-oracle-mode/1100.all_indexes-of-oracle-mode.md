| ORPHANED_ENTRIES | VARCHAR2(3) | NO | Indicates whether the global index partition contains obsolete entries because index maintenance is delayed by the DROP/TRUNCATE PARTITION or MODIFY PARTITION INDEXING OFF operation. Valid values:<li>`YES`: The index partition contains orphaned entries.<li>`NO`: The index partition does not contain orphaned entries. |
| INDEXING | VARCHAR2(7) | NO | Indicates whether the global index is separated from the base table. Valid values:<li>`PARTIAL`: The index is partial and follows the index attribute of the table.<li>`FULL`: The index contains all partitions of the table. |
