# DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG_SUMMARY

## Purpose

The `DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG_SUMMARY` view displays the status of all historical and current log archiving tasks.

  <p>This view is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

## Columns

| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEST_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The path ID. The system allocates a unique ID to each specified path. |
| ROUND_ID | NUMBER(38) | NO | The nth complete clog backup data flow. |
| INCARNATION | NUMBER(38) | NO | The nth incarnation of the database after the Flashback Database operation. |
| DEST_NO | NUMBER(38) | NO | The log archive destination number. For example, the destination number of `log_archive_dest` is `0`, and that of `log_archive_dest_1` is `1`. |
| STATUS | VARCHAR2(64) | NO | The archiving status. Valid values:<ul><li>`PREPARE`: The start SCN for log archiving is being prepared.`START_SCN`</li> <li>`BEGINNING`: Log archiving is being started.  </li> <li>`DOING`: Log archiving is in progress. </li><li> `INTERRUPTED`: Log archiving is interrupted and requires manual intervention. </li><li>`STOP`: Log archiving is stopped.  </li><li>`STOPPING`: Log archiving is being stopped.  </li><li>`SUSPENDING`: Log archiving is being suspended.  </li><li>`SUSPEND`: Log archiving is suspended.  </li></ul> |
| START_SCN | NUMBER(38) | NO | The SCN at which the backup starts. |

Valid values:<ul><li> `none`: indicates that the archived log data is not compressed. </li><li> `lz4_1.0`: indicates that the `lz4_1.0` compression algorithm is used to compress the archived log data. </li><li>`zstd_1.3.8`: indicates that the `zstd_1.3.8` compression algorithm is used to compress the archived log data.</li></ul>At present, this column is not supported. |
| INPUT_BYTES | NUMBER | NO | The volume of data read.<br>At present, OceanBase Database does not support this column. |
| INPUT_BYTES_DISPLAY | VARCHAR2(42) | NO | The size of the read data with the unit of measurement. For example, the value can be 798.01 M or 5.25 G.<br>At present, OceanBase Database does not support this column. |
