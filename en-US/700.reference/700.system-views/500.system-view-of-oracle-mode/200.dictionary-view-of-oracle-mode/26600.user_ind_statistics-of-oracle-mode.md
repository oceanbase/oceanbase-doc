| Column | Type | Nullable? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INDEX_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the index. |
| TABLE_OWNER | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The owner of the index object. |
| TABLE_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the index object. |
| PARTITION_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the partition. |
| PARTITION_POSITION | NUMBER | NO | The position of the partition within the index. |
| SUBPARTITION_NAME | VARCHAR2(128) | NO | The name of the subpartition. |
| SUBPARTITION_POSITION | NUMBER | NO | The position of the subpartition in the partition. |
| OBJECT_TYPE | VARCHAR2(12) | NO | The type of the object. Valid values:<li>INDEX<li>PARTITION<li>SUBPARTITION |
| BLEVEL | NUMBER | NO | The B-Tree level. |
| LEAF_BLOCKS | NUMBER | NO | The number of leaf blocks in the index. |
| DISTINCT_KEYS | NUMBER | NO | The number of distinct keys in the index. |
| AVG_LEAF_BLOCKS_PER_KEY | NUMBER | NO | The average number of leaf blocks per key. |
| AVG_DATA_BLOCKS_PER_KEY | NUMBER | NO | The average number of data blocks per key. |
| CLUSTERING_FACTOR | NUMBER | NO | The sequential characteristics of rows in the table based on the value of the index.<li>If the value is close to the number of blocks, the table is well ordered. In this case, the index entries in a single leaf block usually point to rows in the same data block.<li>If the value is close to the number of rows, the table is randomly ordered. In this case, index entries in the same leaf block are unlikely to point to rows in the same data block. |
| NUM_ROWS | NUMBER | NO | The number of rows in the index. |
| AVG_CACHED_BLOCKS | NUMBER | NO | The average number of blocks in the buffer cache. |
| AVG_CACHE_HIT_RATIO | NUMBER | NO | The average cache hit rate of the object. |
| SAMPLE_SIZE | NUMBER | NO | The sample size used for index analysis. |
| LAST_ANALYZED | DATE | NO | The date on which the index was analyzed the last time. |
| GLOBAL_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | NO | Indicates whether the statistics are collected or incrementally maintained. Valid values:<li>YES<li>NO |
| USER_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | NO | Indicates whether the statistics are directly entered by the user. Valid values:<li>YES<li>NO |
| STATTYPE_LOCKED | VARCHAR2(5) | NO | The type of the statistics lock. |
| STALE_STATS | VARCHAR2(3) | NO | Indicates whether the statistics of the object are stale. |
| SCOPE | VARCHAR2(7) | NO | Indicates whether statistics are collected from any table other than global temporary tables.<br>For global temporary tables, the value can be:<li>`SESSION`: indicates that the statistics are session-specific.<li>`SHARED`: indicates that statistics are shared across all sessions. |
