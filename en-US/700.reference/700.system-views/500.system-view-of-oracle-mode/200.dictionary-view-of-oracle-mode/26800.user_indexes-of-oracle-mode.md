| ORPHANED_ENTRIES | VARCHAR2(3) | NO | Indicates whether the global index partition contains obsolete entries because index maintenance is delayed by the `DROP PARTITION`, `TRUNCATE PARTITION`, or `MODIFY PARTITION INDEXING OFF` operation. Valid values:<ul><li>`YES`: The index partition contains orphaned entries. </li><li>`NO`: The index partition does not contain orphaned entries. </li></ul> |
| INDEXING | VARCHAR2(7) | NO | Indicates whether the global index is separated from the base table. Valid values:<ul><li>`PARTIAL`: The index is partial and follows the index attribute of the table. </li><li>`FULL`: The index contains all partitions of the table.  </li> </ul> |
