# USER_IND_SUBPARTITIONS

Purpose
-----------

The `USER_IND_SUBPARTITIONS` view displays all index subpartitions owned by the current user in the database. This view does not have the `INDEX_OWNER` column compared with the `DBA_IND_SUBPARTITIONS` and `ALL_IND_SUBPARTITIONS` views.

<main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only MySQL mode. </p>
