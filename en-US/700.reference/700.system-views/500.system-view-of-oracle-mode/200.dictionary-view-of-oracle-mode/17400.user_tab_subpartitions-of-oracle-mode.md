Valid values:<li>NO MEMCOMPRESS<li>FOR DML<li>FOR QUERY \[ LOW | HIGH \]<li>FOR CAPACITY \[ LOW | HIGH \]<li>AUTO<li>NULL<br>This value is based on the location of the middle section of the table.

The service name is saved in the `INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME` column. |
| INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME | VARCHAR2(1000) | NO | The name of the service on which in-memory column store is padded. This column has values only when `INMEMORY_SERVICE` is set to `USER_DEFINED`, and is empty in other cases. |
