| INMEMORY | VARCHAR2(8) | NO | Indicates whether in-memory column store is enabled for the subpartition. Valid values:<li> `ENABLED`: In-memory column store is enabled.<li>`DISABLED`: In-memory column store is disabled. |
| INMEMORY_PRIORITY | VARCHAR2(8) | NO | The padding priority of the in-memory column store. Valid values:<li>LOW<li>MEDIUM<li>HIGH<li>CRITICAL<li>NONE<li>NULL |

Valid values:<li>NO MEMCOMPRESS<li>FOR DML<li>FOR QUERY \[ LOW \| HIGH \]<li>FOR CAPACITY \[ LOW \| HIGH \]<li>AUTO<li>NULL<br>This value is based on the location of the middle section of the table.

The service name is saved in the `INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME` column. |
| INMEMORY_SERVICE_NAME | VARCHAR2(1000) | NO | The name of the service on which in-memory column store is padded. This column has values only when `INMEMORY_SERVICE` is set to `USER_DEFINED`, and is empty in other cases. |
