# Configure automatic scale-out of disk space for data files

OceanBase Database supports automatic scale-out of disk space available for data files based on the actual situation.

## Background information

In OceanBase Database, the files used to store data are named `block_file`. These `block_file` files are located in the `/store/sstable` directory under the installation directory of OBServer nodes. They are created after each OBServer node is started. The size of the `block_file` files is controlled by the `datafile_size` or `datafile_disk_percentage` parameter. For more information about the directory of data files on OBServer nodes, see [Structure of the OBServer installation directory](../../100.oceanbase-database-concepts/1200.observer-node-architecture/100.observer-installation-directory-structure.md).

Prior to OceanBase Database V4.2.0, the system adopted a pre-allocation approach where a portion of disk space was reserved for data files. This ensured that the data files occupied a contiguous section of the disk space, preventing insufficient disk resources caused by other applications preempting the disk. However, this pre-allocation method occupied a significant amount of disk space, and even if the disk space was not being used, it could not be released.

To address this issue, OceanBase Database introduced several parameters for progressive disk space utilization for data files. The system first pre-allocates a reasonable disk size for the data files and then automatically scales out based on the actual disk usage and user configuration.

## Related parameters

OceanBase Database automatically scales out the disk space available for the data file on an OBServer node based on the following parameters:

* `datafile_size`: the size of disk space available for the data file. The default value is `0M`. For more information about the cluster-level parameter `datafile_size`, see [datafile_size](../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/4700.datafile_size.md).

* `datafile_disk_percentage`: the percentage of disk space that can be occupied by the data file. The default value is `0`. For more information about the cluster-level parameter `datafile_disk_percentage`, see [datafile_disk_percentage](../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/4400.datafile_disk_percentage.md).

* `datafile_next`: the automatic scale-out step for the disk space for the data file. The default value is `0M`, which indicates that automatic scale-out is disabled. To enable automatic scale-out, you need to set the parameter to a nonzero value. For more information about the cluster-level parameter `datafile_next`, see [datafile_next](../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/4600.datafile_next.md).

* `datafile_maxsize`: the maximum size of disk space allowed for automatic scale-out for the data file. The default value is `0M`, which indicates that automatic scale-out is disabled. For more information about the cluster-level parameter `datafile_maxsize`, see [datafile_maxsize](../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/4500.datafile_maxsize.md).

Take note of the following rules when you set the preceding parameters:

* You can use either `datafile_size` or `datafile_disk_percentage` to configure the disk space available for the data file.  

   * If you set both `datafile_size` and `datafile_disk_percentage` to nonzero values, the value of `datafile_size` prevails.

   * If `datafile_size` is set to `0M` and `datafile_disk_percentage` is set to `0`, the system automatically calculates the percentage of disk space available for the data file based on whether logs and data are stored on the same disk.

      * If logs and data are stored on the same disk, the percentage of disk space available for the data file is 60%.

      * If logs and data are stored on different disks, the percentage of disk space available for the data file is 90%.

* When you set `datafile_maxsize`, make sure that its value is greater than the current size of disk space available for the data file, which is specified by `datafile_size` or `datafile_disk_percentage`. Otherwise, automatic scale-out is not triggered.

* If the value of `datafile_maxsize` exceeds the maximum available space of the current disk, the actual size of available space is used as the maximum value.

* Take note of the following rules when you set `datafile_next`:

   * If `datafile_next` is set to a value smaller than or equal to `1G`, the actual value of `datafile_next` is calculated by using the `min(1G, datafile_maxsize Ã— 10%)` formula.

   * If `datafile_next` is set to a value greater than `1G`, the actual value of `datafile_next` is calculated by using the `min(datafile_next, Remaining disk space)` formula.

## Considerations and limitations

* When you configure automatic scale-out of disk space for the data file, we recommend that you set the initial value of `datafile_next` to 20% of the value of `datafile_maxsize`, to avoid frequent scale-out.

* After you enable automatic scale-out of disk space for data files, you must make a proper capacity plan for other applications deployed on the same server, and make sure that the maximum size of disk space available for scale-out is no smaller than the value of `datafile_maxsize`.

* At present, automatic scale-in of disk space for data files is not supported.

* If you do not want to enable automatic scale-out, you can set `datafile_next` or `datafile_maxsize` to `0M`, or retain the default value `0M`. Then, the system will reserve a part of the disk space for the data file based on the original pre-allocation mechanism.

## Enable automatic disk space scale-out for data files

### Step 1: View the current parameter values

Before you configure dynamic disk space scale-out for data files, you must first view the current parameter values.

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statements to view the parameter values:

   ```sql
   SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'datafile_size';
   ```

   ```sql
   SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'datafile_disk_percentage';
   ```

   ```sql
   SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'datafile_next';
   ```

   ```sql
   SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'datafile_maxsize';
   ```

### Step 2: Configure dynamic disk space scale-out for data files

You can modify the parameter values for automatic disk space scale-out for data files based on the actual situation.

#### datafile_size (or datafile_disk_percentage), datafile_next, and datafile_maxsize are set when your cluster is started

Take note of the following rules if you set `datafile_size` (or `datafile_disk_percentage`), `datafile_next`, and `datafile_maxsize` to nonzero values when you deploy OceanBase Database and start your OceanBase cluster:

* If the value of `datafile_maxsize` is greater than that of `datafile_size`, or greater than the disk space size calculated based on `datafile_disk_percentage`, automatic scale-out takes effect after the cluster is started.

* If the value of `datafile_maxsize` is smaller than that of `datafile_size`, or smaller than the disk space size calculated based on `datafile_disk_percentage`, you must first change the value of `datafile_maxsize` to a value greater than that of `datafile_size` before you enable automatic disk space scale-out for data files.

#### Only datafile_size (or datafile_disk_percentage) is set when the cluster is started

If you set only `datafile_size` or `datafile_disk_percentage` when you deploy OceanBase Database and start your OceanBase cluster, you need to manually set only `datafile_maxsize` and `datafile_next` and make sure that the value of `datafile_maxsize` is greater than that of `datafile_size`, or greater than the disk space size calculated based on `datafile_disk_percentage`.

#### datafile_size (or datafile_disk_percentage), datafile_next, and datafile_maxsize are not set when the cluster is started

If you do not set `datafile_size` (or `datafile_disk_percentage`), `datafile_next`, and `datafile_maxsize` when you deploy OceanBase Database and start the OceanBase cluster, you can enable automatic disk space scale-out for data files by referring to the following procedure.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>Whether <code>datafile_size</code> or <code>datafile_disk_percentage</code> is set when the cluster is started for the first time affects the initial size of disk space available for data files. </p>
</main>

To do so, perform the following steps:

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to query the size of the pre-allocated disk space:

   ```sql
   SELECT data_disk_allocated/1024/1024/1024 AS datafile_G FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS;
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-------------------+
   | datafile_G        |
   +-------------------+
   | 1770.000000000000 |
   +-------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The query result shows that the size of the disk space pre-allocated (`data_disk_allocated`) to the data file is 1,770 GB (about 1.7 TB).

   For more information about fields in the `GV$OB_SERVERS` view, see [GV$OB_SERVERS](../../700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/300.performance-view-of-mysql-mode/3200.gv-ob_servers-of-mysql-mode.md).

3. Set `datafile_maxsize` to a value greater than that of `data_disk_allocated`, and set `datafile_next` to a nonzero value.

   Here are some examples:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET datafile_maxsize='4TB';
   ```

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM SET datafile_next='1TB';
   ```

4. Execute the following statement to verify whether the automatic scale-out settings take effect:

   ```sql
   SELECT data_disk_allocated/1024/1024/1024 AS datafile_G, data_disk_capacity/1024/1024/1024 AS datafile_max_G FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SERVERS;
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-------------------+-------------------+
   | datafile_G        | datafile_max_G    |
   +-------------------+-------------------+
   | 1770.000000000000 | 4096.000000000000 |
   +-------------------+-------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The query result shows that the maximum capacity (`data_disk_capacity`) for automatic scale-out of disk space for the data file is the value of `datafile_maxsize`, and the value of `data_disk_capacity` is greater than that of `data_disk_allocated`. This indicates that the automatic scale-out settings take effect.

### What to do next

After the configuration, the system automatically scales out the disk space for data files based on the actual situation and the values of `datafile_next` and `datafile_maxsize`.
