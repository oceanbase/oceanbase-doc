# View the thread status

When your database is running, you can view the status of threads in the current cluster as needed to facilitate troubleshooting or performance diagnostics.

## Background information

Threads can be classified into worker threads and background threads. Worker threads are tenant-specific and therefore are also called tenant worker threads. Background threads contain both tenant-specific and non-tenant-specific threads.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL or Oracle tenant of the cluster as an administrator user.

2. Execute the following statement to view the status of threads.

   * MySQL mode

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_THREAD;
     ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

     ```shell
     +----------------+----------+-----------+------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+
     | SVR_IP         | SVR_PORT | TENANT_ID | TID  | TNAME           | STATUS | LATCH_WAIT | LATCH_HOLD | TRACE_ID                          |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+

     | xx.xx.xx.xx    |     2882 |      1002 | 7262 | T1002_L0_G2     | Wait   |            |            | Y0-0000000000000000-0-0           |
     | xx.xx.xx.xx    |     2882 |      1002 | 7102 | T1002_L0_G0     | Wait   |            |            | Y0-0000000000000000-0-0           |
     | xx.xx.xx.xx    |     2882 |      1002 | 7101 | T1002_L0_G0     | Wait   |            |            | Y0-0000000000000000-0-0           |
     | xx.xx.xx.xx    |     2882 |      1002 | 7100 | T1002_L0_G0     | Wait   |            |            | Y0-0000000000000000-0-0           |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+------+-----------------+--------+------------+------------+-----------------------------------+
     10 rows in set
     ```

   * Oracle mode

     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM SYS.GV$OB_THREAD;
     ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

     ```shell
     +----------------+----------+-----------+------+--------------+--------+------------+------------+-------------------------+
     | SVR_IP         | SVR_PORT | TENANT_ID | TID  | TNAME        | STATUS | LATCH_WAIT | LATCH_HOLD | TRACE_ID                |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+------+--------------+--------+------------+------------+-------------------------+
     | xx.xx.xx.xx    |     2882 |      1004 | 7372 | T1004_CdcSrv | Sleep  | NULL       | NULL       | Y0-0000000000000000-0-0 |
     +----------------+----------+-----------+------+--------------+--------+------------+------------+-------------------------+
     1 row in set
     ```

   In the query result, each row indicates a thread. The query result may vary based on the query time. When a thread is created, the system adds a thread record in the table. When a thread ends, the system deletes the corresponding thread record from the table.

   Columns in the query result are described as follows.

   | Column | Description |
   |-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
   | SVR_IP | The IP address of the OBServer node where the current thread resides. |
   | SVR_PORT | The port number of the OBServer node where the current thread resides. |
   | TENANT_ID | The ID of the tenant to which the current thread belongs. The tenant ID of a process-level thread is 500.  |
   | TID | The ID of the thread. |
   | TNAME | The name of the thread. |
   | STATUS | The status of the thread. Valid values:<ul><li>`Run`: The thread is in the running state. </li><li>`Wait`: The thread is in the waiting state.</li><li>`Sleep`: The thread is in the sleep state.</li><li>`Join`: The thread is waiting for another thread to end.</li></ul> |
   | LATCH_WAIT | The address of the latch that the current thread is waiting for. |
   | LATCH_HOLD | The address of the latch held by the current thread. Multiple latches may be held by the thread. |
   | TRACE_ID | The ID of the trace executed by the current thread. |
