# Monitor a cluster

You can view the monitoring data to learn about the status, performance, and resource usage of each monitored object. This way, you can ensure the availability of follow-up businesses by adjusting resource allocation in time. You can also troubleshoot business exceptions based on the monitoring data.

## Cluster monitoring service

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express provides database performance monitoring and host monitoring services for OceanBase clusters.

On the **Monitoring** page, you can filter the monitoring data that you want to view.

* The following table describes the filter conditions.

   | Filter condition | Description |
   |---------------|----------------|
   | Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode.  Select a time range for the data that you want to query.  |
   | Zone | By default, the monitoring information of all zones is displayed.  |
   | OBServer | By default, the monitoring information of all OBServer nodes is displayed.  |
   | Auto Refresh | <ul><li>If **Auto Refresh** is disabled, after you specify the filter conditions, the system displays the performance monitoring data based on the specified values of **Select Time** and **Stat Period**. </li><li>If **Auto Refresh** is enabled, after you specify a statistical range, the system displays the real-time performance monitoring data in the specified statistical range. </li></ul> |

* You can view cluster monitoring data on the following tabs:

   * **Database Performance**: displays the following data in charts: **QPS**, **Query Response Time**, **TPS**, **Transaction Response Time**, **Sessions**, **Request Waiting Queue Time Consumption**, **Number of Transaction Logs**, **Transaction Log Volume**, **Transaction Log Time Consumption**, **IOPS**, **I/O Time**, **I/O Throughput**, and **Transactions**.

   * **Host Performance**: displays the following data in charts: **Linux System Load**, **CPU Utilization**, **Memory**, **I/O Utilization**, **I/O Queue Size**, **IOPS**, **I/O Time**, **I/O Throughput**, and **Network Throughput**.
