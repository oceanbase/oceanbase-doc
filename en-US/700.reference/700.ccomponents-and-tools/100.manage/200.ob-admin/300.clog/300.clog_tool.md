# clog_tool

Commit logs (clogs) in OceanBase Database are similar to redo logs in a conventional database. They persist the transaction data when transactions are committed. The transaction data is the record of transaction modifications to the database. This topic describes how to use clog_tool to parse and print clog files.

## clog_tool commands

clog_tool is integrated with ob_admin. You can run the `ob_admin` commands to call clog_tool.
The following table describes frequently used clog_tool commands.

| Command | Description |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|
| `dump_all` | Parses and prints the specified clog file.  |
| `dump_hex` | Parses and prints the specified clog file, and converts non-printable characters into hexadecimal characters.  |
| `dump_format` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the file in a format that is similar to SQL statements.  |
| `dump_filter` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the log records that meet the specified conditions.  |
| `stat_clog` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the statistics of the file.  |
| `dump_meta` | Parses the specified clog file and prints only the transaction information in log records, rather than user data.  |

### dump_all

```Shell
ob_admin clog_tool dump_all <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can use the `dump_all` command to parse and print the specified clog file. If you want to parse multiple files, separate the file names with spaces.

* You must replace the `clog_file_name` string with the actual file name. The path of the file can be included in `clog_file_name`. Examples:

   * To parse and print a single clog file that is named `101` and located in the current directory, run the following command:

      ```Shell
      ob_admin clog_tool dump_all 101
      ```

   * To parse and print multiple clog files that are named `101` and `103` and located in the current directory, run the following command:

      ```Shell
      ob_admin clog_tool dump_all 101 103
      ```

   * To parse and print multiple clog files that are consecutively named `101`, `102`, `103`, and `104` and located in the current directory, run the following command:

      ```Shell
      ob_admin clog_tool dump_all {101..104}
      ```

### dump_hex

```Shell
ob_admin clog_tool dump_hex <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* If a clog file contains non-printable characters, ob_admin cannot print these characters by calling the `dump_all` command. In this case, you can use the `dump_hex` command to convert the non-printable characters into hexadecimal characters and then print them.

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see **dump_all**.

### dump_format

```Shell
ob_admin clog_tool dump_format <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* Logs printed by the `dump_all` command are not friendly to readers. You can use the `dump_format` command to parse and print the specified clog file in a format that is similar to SQL statements.

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see **dump_all**.

### dump_filter

```Shell
ob_admin clog_tool dump_filter '<filter_name>' <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can use the `dump_filter` command to print clog records that meet the specified conditions. This reduces the number of printed clog records and facilitates troubleshooting.

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see **dump_all**.

* You can filter log records by specifying filter conditions in the `filter_name` field. The following table describes the valid values of filter_name.

   |     Value     |   Description    |
   |----------------|---------|
   | `table_id`     | The data table identifier.  |
   | `partition_id` | The data partition identifier. |
   | `log_id`       | The log record identifier. |

   You can specify one or multiple filter conditions in the `filter_name` field. If you specify multiple filter conditions, separate the conditions with semicolons (<span>;</span>). Examples:

   * If you want to parse and print the clog file `101` in the current directory and filter out records of the table `123` in the clog file, run the following command:

      ```Shell
      ob_admin clog_tool dump_filter 'table_id=123' 101
      ```

   * If you want to parse and print the clog file `101` in the current directory and filter out records of the table ``123`` and partition ``2`` in the clog file, run the following command:

      ```Shell
      ob_admin clog_tool dump_filter 'table_id=123;partition_id=2' 101
      ```

### stat_clog

```Shell
ob_admin clog_tool stat_clog <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can use the `stat_clog` command to obtain statistics of the specified clog file, including the file size, number of records, and number of transactions.

   > **Note**
   >
   > By using the `CLOG_TOOL_BREAK_ON_FAIL` environment variable, clog_tool can control whether to directly exit or to ignore errors and continue. When `CLOG_TOOL_BREAK_ON_FAIL` is set to true, clog_tool directly exits. When `CLOG_TOOL_BREAK_ON_FAIL` is set to false, clog_tool ignores errors and continues parsing the specified clog file.

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see **dump_all**.

### dump_meta

```Shell
ob_admin clog_tool dump_meta <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can use the `dump_meta` command to obtain the specified clog file and print only the transaction information in the log records, rather than user data. This helps ensure user data security in some cases.
* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see **dump_all**.
