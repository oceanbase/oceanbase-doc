# Field naming conventions

When you create a data table, you must follow specific conventions for naming fields. This topic provides guidelines for standardizing field names within a database.

## Field naming suggestions

* Use either all uppercase letters or all lowercase letters for field names. Do not use a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters.

* Start field names with letters.

* Use field names that well represent the data content of the column, for example, "NAME".

* Do not start or end field names with underscores (_).

* Do not start field names with digits.

* Do not use reserved words or keywords in field names.

* Do not enclose digits in underscores (_) in field names.

* Do not use plural forms in field names.

* Use feature names that represent the functionality of the field or use standard abbreviations, separated by an underscore. The recommended format is "BUSINESS NAME_FIELD FEATURE". For example, "TASK_NUM", "CREATE_DATE", "STATION_DESC", and "TASK_ID".
