# Memory tools

## free

You can use `free` to view the overall memory usage on the server. 

Synopsis:

```unknow
free [<options>]
```

The parameters are described as follows:

Valid values of `options`:

* `-m`: specifies to return the memory size in MB. By default, the memory size is returned in KB. 

* `-g`: specifies to return the memory size in GB. By default, the memory size is returned in KB. 

The following sample statement checks the overall memory usage on the server:

```unknow
$free
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:      791791184    80578952   528945156       68244   182267076   702805628
Swap:             0           0           0
```

The fields are described as follows:

* `total`: indicates the total physical memory. Total physical memory = Total idle physical memory + Total cache memory + Total physical memory in use. 

* `used`: indicates the total physical memory in use. 

* `free`: indicates the total idle physical memory. 

* `shared`: indicates the total shared memory. 

* `buff/cache`: indicates the total cache memory. 

* `available`: indicates the total physical memory available. Total physical memory available = Total idle physical memory + Total cache memory.
