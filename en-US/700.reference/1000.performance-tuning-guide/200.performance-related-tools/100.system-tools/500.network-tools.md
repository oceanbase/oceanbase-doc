# Network tools

## sar

You can use `sar` to obtain system activity reports, which show the file read/write status, system call usage, disk I/O, CPU utilization, memory usage, process activities, and IPC-related activities. You can use `sar` to monitor network conditions. 

Synopsis:

```unknow
sar -n [keyword]  [ <interval> [ <count> ] ]
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* `-n`: monitors network performance. 

* Valid keywords:

   * `DEV`: displays network interface information. 
   * `EDEV`: displays statistics on network errors. 
   * `NFS`: collects statistics about active NFS clients. 
   * `NFSD`: collects statistics about the NFS server. 
   * `SOCK`: displays socket information. 
   * `ALL`: displays all five switches. 

* `interval`: the output refresh interval. 

* `count`: the number of output times. 

You can run the `sar -n` command to view the transmission rate on each NIC. Here is an example:

```unknow
$sar -n DEV 1
09:01:53 PM     IFACE   rxpck/s   txpck/s    rxkB/s    txkB/s   rxcmp/s   txcmp/s  rxmcst/s

```

The fields are described as follows:

* `IFACE:` the name of the server NIC. 

* `rxpck/s`: the number of packets received per second. 

* `txpck/s`: the number of packets sent per second. 

* `rxKB/S`: the size of packets received per second, in KB. 

* `txKB/S`: the size of packets sent per second, in KB. 

* `rxcmp/s`: the number of compressed packets received per second. 

* `txcmp/s`: the number of compressed packets sent per second. 

* `rxmcst/s`: the number of multicast packets received per second. 

## vsar

You can use `vsar` to trace the network load over a period. 

Run the `vsar --traffic --tcp` command to trace the historical network load. Here is an example:

```unknow

The fields are described as follows:

* `tcp`

   * `active`: the number of connections initiated actively per second. 
   * `pasive`: the number of passively established connections per second. 
   * `iseg`: the number of inbound TCP packets per second. 
   * `outseg`: the number of outbound TCP packets per second. 
   * `EstRes`: the number of connections reset per second. 
   * `AtmpFa`: the number of connection initiation failures per second. For example, the failure can be caused if the syn packet is discarded because the semi-join queue is full. 
   * `CurrEs`: the number of current TCP connections. 
   * `retran`: the retransmission rate calculated based on the retransmitted segments and the total segments. 

* `traffic`

   * `bytin`: the number of bytes received by the physical host NIC per second. Generally, 960 MB is the upper limit for a 10 GE NIC. 
   * `bytout`: the number of bytes sent by the physical host NIC per second. 
   * `pktin`: the number of packets received by the physical host NIC per second. 
   * `pktout`: the number of packets sent by the physical host NIC per second. 
   * `inerr`: the number of inbound packet errors. 
   * `outerr`: the number of outbound packet errors. 
   * `indrp`: the number of inbound packets dropped. 
   * `outdrp`: the number of outbound packets dropped.
