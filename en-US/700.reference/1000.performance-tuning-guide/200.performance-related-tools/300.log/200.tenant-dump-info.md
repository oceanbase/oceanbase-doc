You can search logs by using the keywords "dump tenant info" to view tenant information, such as resource specifications, threads, queues, and request statistics.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This log is generated for each tenant every 30s in OceanBase Database V4.x and every 10s in OceanBase Database V3.x and earlier versions. </p>
  </main>

The following sample log applies to OceanBase Database V4.x. In other versions of OceanBase Database, only some of the fields in the following sample log apply.
