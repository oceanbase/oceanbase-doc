# Monitor and diagnose the cluster performance

This topic describes the performance monitoring and diagnostics for OceanBase clusters.

## Monitor cluster performance

### Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring**.

4. Enable real-time performance monitoring to view the real-time performance changes.

The following table describes the metric data filter criteria.

| Filter criterion | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Select Time | This parameter is not displayed in auto-refresh mode.  Select a time range for the data that you want to query.  |
| Auto Refresh | By default, auto-refresh is disabled. After auto-refresh is enabled, data is refreshed every 5s.  |
| Zone | The zone whose metric data you want to view. OceanBase Database is a distributed database service, and cluster metrics are collected and aggregated from multiple zones. The aggregation method depends on the metric type. You can select a zone to view metric data of the zone.  |
| OBServer | The OBServer node whose metric data you want to view. OceanBase Database is a distributed database service, and cluster metrics are collected and aggregated from multiple OBServer nodes. The aggregation method depends on the metric type. You can select an OBServer node to view metric data of the OBServer node.  |

Performance metrics are classified into database metrics and host metrics.

## Cluster performance report

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>At present, OCP Community Edition does not support generating performance reports. </p>
  </main>

### Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Clusters**.

2. In the **Clusters** list on the **Clusters** page, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane of the page that appears, click **Performance Report**.

4. Click **Generate Performance Report**. Specify the snapshot start and end points to generate a cluster performance report.

5. Click **View** to view the performance report. The system retains the data for the last 90 days.

6. Click **Download** to download the performance report.

The following table describes the content of a performance report.

| Module | Description |
|------|-------------------------------------|
| Basic information | This module shows the version, OBServer nodes, tenants, and data partitions of the cluster.  |
| Workloads | This module shows the workloads of the cluster.  |
| SQL | This module shows the top SQL information aggregated by metrics such as response time, wait event, and CPU utilization.  |
| Locks | This module shows the row lock requests, waits, and timeouts.  |
