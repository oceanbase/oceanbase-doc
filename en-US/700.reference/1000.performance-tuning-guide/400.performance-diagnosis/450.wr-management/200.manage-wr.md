# Manage WR

OceanBase Database provides a database management system (DBMS) package for you to manage cluster snapshots related to Workload Repository (WR). Specifically, you can manually create snapshots, delete snapshots, and modify the time interval of the timer thread to adjust the sampling frequency for cluster snapshots.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>This feature is supported only in the sys tenant, and is unavailable during upgrade. </p>
</main>

## Create a snapshot

WR automatically creates snapshots. To adjust the snapshot collection time, you can manually create a cluster snapshot. Then, the timer will collect data based on the new time interval. The syntax for creating a snapshot is as follows:

```sql
DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT(
    flush_level  VARCHAR(64) DEFAULT 'TYPICAL'
    );
```

In the syntax, the value of `flush_level` can be only TYPICAL, which indicates the periodic snapshot mode. This means WR collects most statistical data only in periodic snapshot mode. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient [(none)]> CALL DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.CREATE_SNAPSHOT(flush_level => 'TYPICAL');
Query OK, 0 rows affected, 3 warnings (1.112 sec)
```

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>After you manually create a snapshot, the timer restarts counting down. For example, if you enable the periodic snapshot mode when the default time interval of the timer is 1 hour:<ul><li>At 12:21, the timer triggers the creation of a snapshot.  </li><li>At 13:21, the timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot. </li><li>At 13:45, you manually create a snapshot. </li><li>At 14:45, the timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot. </li></ul>After you manually create a snapshot, the timer triggers the creation of the next snapshot based on the set interval. </p>
</main>

## Configure a snapshot strategy

### Configure the snapshot interval and retention period

You can modify the snapshot interval and retention period to adjust the sampling frequency of cluster snapshots. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTINGS(
   retention          INT    DEFAULT  NULL,
   interval           INT    DEFAULT  NULL
   );
```

The following table describes the fields.

| Field | Description |
|------|-----|
| retention | The retention period of snapshots, in minutes. Snapshots that exceed this period are automatically deleted. The value range is [1440 minutes (1 day), 52560000 minutes (100 years)]. <ul><li>The value `0` specifies to permanently retain the snapshots. In this case, the retention period is 57816000 minutes (110 years).  </li><li>The value `NULL` specifies to use the original retention period. </li></ul> |
| interval | The time interval between snapshots, in minutes. The value range is [10 minutes, 525600 minutes (1 year)]. <ul><li>The value `0` specifies to disable automatic and manual snapshots and to use a large value defined by the system (110 years) as the retention period.</li><li>The value `NULL` specifies to use the current time interval.</li></ul> |

Example: Set the snapshot retention period to 2,265 minutes (about 1 day and 12 hours) and the interval between snapshots to 16 minutes.

```sql
obclient [(none)]> CALL DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.MODIFY_SNAPSHOT_SETTINGS('2265','16');
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.006 sec)
```

### View snapshot configurations

* Query the `oceanbase.CDB_WR_CONTROL` view for WR related configurations in all tenants.

## Delete snapshots

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ol><li>Before you delete snapshots, make sure that the snapshot IDs are valid in the system. </li><li>After you delete the snapshots, the snapshot data within the specified range will be permanently deleted. Proceed with caution. </li></ol>
</main>

You can specify the start ID and end ID of snapshots to delete the snapshot data within the specified ID range. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.DROP_SNAPSHOT_RANGE(
    low_snap_id    INT,
    high_snap_id   INT
    );
```

The following table describes the fields.

| Field | Description |
|------|-----|
| low_snap_id | The start ID of snapshots to be deleted. |
| high_snap_id | The end ID of snapshots to be deleted. |

**The snapshot deletion procedure is as follows:**

1. Query all snapshot IDs in the tenant. 

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> select count(1),min(snap_id), max(snap_id) from oceanbase.DBA_WR_SNAPSHOT;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```sql
   +-----------+--------------+--------------+
   | count(1) | min(snap_id) | max(snap_id) |
   +-----------+--------------+--------------+
   |         1 |            2 |            2 |
   +-----------+--------------+--------------+
   1 row in set (0.039 sec)
   ```

2. Delete the snapshot data within the specified ID range. 

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> CALL DBMS_WORKLOAD_REPOSITORY.DROP_SNAPSHOT_RANGE('2','2');
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (1.018 sec)
   ```

3. Query whether the snapshots are successfully deleted. 

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> select count(1),min(snap_id), max(snap_id) from oceanbase.DBA_WR_SNAPSHOT;
   ```
