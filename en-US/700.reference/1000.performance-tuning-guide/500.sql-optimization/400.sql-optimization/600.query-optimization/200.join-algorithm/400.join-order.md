# Join order

For queries to join multiple tables, an important task of the optimizer is to determine the join order of tables, which has effects on the size of the intermediate result sets and the overall cost of plan execution.

To reduce the search range and memory usage for plan execution, the OceanBase Database optimizer uses the left-deep join tree to determine the join order. The following figure shows the shapes of a left-deep tree, a right-deep tree, and a bushy tree.

OceanBase Database uses the System-R dynamic programming algorithm to generate the join order. It takes into account many factors, such as the possible access paths of each table, interesting order, join selectivity of different tables, and join algorithms (nested loop join, block nested loop join, and sort-merge join).

To join N tables, OceanBase Database determines the join order in the following steps:

1. Generate an access path for every base table and reserve the path that has the lowest cost and those with an interesting order. If a path has an interesting order, its order is usable by subsequent operators.

2. Generate all plans with a table set size of `i (1 < i <= N)`. OceanBase Database generally only chooses the left-deep tree. A plan with a table set size of `i` can comprise a plan of its own and a base table plan. Based on this strategy, OceanBase Database generates all plans with a table set size of `i`, taking into account factors such as all join algorithms and the inheritance of the interesting order. Again, only the plan that has the lowest cost and plans with an interesting order are kept.

OceanBase Database also allows you to use the hint `/*+LEADING(table_name_list)*/` to control the order of a multi-table join.

In the following example, tables `t1` and `t2` are joined first, followed by table `t3`. If you want to join tables `t2` and `t3` first before the join of `t1`, you can add the hint `/*+LEADING(t2,t3,t1)*/` to the query. If you want to join `t1` and `t3` first before the join of `t2`, you can add the hint `/*+LEADING(t1,t3,t2)*/`.
