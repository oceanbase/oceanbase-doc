# Rule-based query rewrite

Rule-based query rewrite includes subquery-related rewrite, outer join elimination, simplified condition rewrite, and non-select project join (non-SPJ) rewrite.

## Subquery related rewrite

The optimizer usually executes subqueries in a nested way, which means that each time a parent query generates a row of data, the optimizer executes a subquery. This method requires multiple subqueries to be executed, resulting in low execution efficiency. To optimize the execution, the nested operation is rewritten to a join, which greatly improves the execution efficiency because of the following benefits:

* It avoids the repeated execution of the same subquery.

* The optimizer selects a better join order and better join algorithms based on the statistics.

* After the join and filter conditions of the subquery are rewritten as the conditions of the parent query, more optimization options are available to the optimizer, such as conditional pushdown.

Frequently applied methods to rewrite a subquery include view merge, subquery expansion, and rewriting `ANY` or `ALL` by using `MAX` or `MIN`.

### View merge

View merge refers to the process of merging a subquery that represents a view into a query that contains the view. The merge provides the optimizer with more options of join order types, access paths, and rewrites, making the selection of a better execution plan much easier.

OceanBase Database supports the merge of SPJ views. In the following example, Q1 is rewritten to Q2:

```javascript
obclient>CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient>CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient>CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Q1:
obclient>SELECT t1.c1, v.c1
                FROM t1, (SELECT t2.c1, t3.c2
                FROM t2, t3
                WHERE t2.c1 = t3.c1) v
                WHERE t1.c2 = v.c2;
<==>
Q2:
obclient>SELECT t1.c1, t2.c1
                FROM t1, t2, t3
                WHERE t2.c1 = t3.c1 AND t1.c2 = t3.c2;
```

Before the rewrite, the types of join orders available for query Q1 are as follows:

* `t1`, `v(t2,t3)`

* `t1`, `v(t3,t2)`

* `v(t2,t3)`, `t1`

* `v(t3,t2)`, `t1`

After the rewrite, the following types of join orders are available:

* `t1`, `t2`, `t3`

* `t1`, `t3`, `t2`

* `t2`, `t1`, `t3`

* `t2`, `t3`, `t1`

* `t3`, `t1`, `t2`

* `t3`, `t2`, `t1`

This indicates that view merge increases options for the join order. For complex queries, view merge provides higher flexibility in selecting access paths and rewrite methods, allowing the optimizer to generate a better plan.

### Subquery unnesting

Subquery unnesting promotes the subquery in a `WHERE` condition to the parent query and unnests it to produce a join condition in parallel with the parent query. The rewrite deconstructs the subquery and changes the outer parent query to a multi-table join.

The benefit is that the optimizer takes into account tables in the subquery when it selects access paths, join methods, and sorting methods, thus obtaining a better execution plan. Relevant subquery unnesting expressions include `NOT IN`, `IN`, `NOT EXIST`, `EXIST`, `ANY`, and `ALL`.

You can unnest a subquery by using the following methods:

* Rewrite conditions so that the generated join statement is enabled to return the same rows as the original statement.

* Unnest a subquery to produce a semi join or anti join.

   In the following example, `t2.c2` is not unique and the statement is rewritten to a semi join. The new execution plan is as follows:

   ```javascript
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 IN (SELECT t2.c2 FROM t2);

   Query Plan:
   =======================================
   |ID|OPERATOR      |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
   ---------------------------------------
   |0 |HASH SEMI JOIN|    |495      |3931|
   |1 | TABLE SCAN   |t1  |1000     |499 |
   |2 | TABLE SCAN   |t2  |1000     |433 |
   =======================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
         equal_conds([t1.c1 = t2.c2]), other_conds(nil)
     1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
         access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0)
     2 - output([t2.c2]), filter(nil),
         access([t2.c2]), partitions(p0)
   ```

   After you change the operator before a query to `NOT IN`, you can rewrite the query to an anti join. The new execution plan is as follows:

   ```javascript
   obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 NOT IN (SELECT t2.c2 FROM t2);

   Query Plan:
   ================================================
   |ID|OPERATOR             |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST  |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |0 |NESTED-LOOP ANTI JOIN|    |0        |520245|
   |1 | TABLE SCAN          |t1  |1000     |499   |
   |2 | TABLE SCAN          |t2  |22       |517   |
   ================================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
         conds(nil), nl_params_([t1.c1], [(T_OP_IS, t1.c1, NULL, 0)])
     1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [(T_OP_IS, t1.c1, NULL, 0)]), filter(nil),
         access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0)
     2 - output([t2.c2]), filter([(T_OP_OR, ? = t2.c2, ?, (T_OP_IS, t2.c2, NULL, 0))]),
         access([t2.c2]), partitions(p0)
   ```

* Unnest a subquery to produce an inner join.

   For query Q1 in the preceding example, if `t2.c2` is changed to `t2.c1`, which is the primary key, the output of the subquery is unique, and you can rewrite it to an inner join, as shown in the following example:

   ```javascript
   Q1:
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 IN  (SELECT t2.c1 FROM t2);
   <==>
   Q2:
   obclient> SELECT t1.* FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1;
   ```

   The execution plan of query Q1 is then rewritten as follows:

   ```javascript
   obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 IN (SELECT t2.c1 FROM t2);

   Query Plan:
    ====================================
   |ID|OPERATOR   |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
   ------------------------------------
   |0 |HASH JOIN  |    |1980     |3725|
   |1 | TABLE SCAN|t2  |1000     |411 |
   |2 | TABLE SCAN|t1  |1000     |499 |
   ====================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
         equal_conds([t1.c1 = t2.c1]), other_conds(nil)
     1 - output([t2.c1]), filter(nil),
         access([t2.c1]), partitions(p0)
     2 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
         access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0)
   ```

   You can rewrite subquery expressions, such as `NOT IN`, `IN`, `NOT EXIST`, `EXIST`, `ANY`, and `ALL`, in the same way.

## Rewrite ANY or ALL by using MAX or MIN

For a subquery with an `ANY` or `ALL` expression, if the subquery does not contain a `GROUP BY` clause, aggregate function, or `HAVING` clause, the expression shown in the following example can be equivalently converted by the aggregate function `MIN` or `MAX`, where `col_item` is a separate, non-`NULL` column:

```sql
val > ALL(SELECT col_item ...)  <==> val > (SELECT MAX(col_item) ...);
val >= ALL(SELECT col_item ...) <==> val >= (SELECT MAX(col_item) ...);
val < ALL(SELECT col_item ...)  <==> val < (SELECT MIN(col_item) ...);
val <= ALL(SELECT col_item ...) <==> val <= (SELECT MIN(col_item) ...);
val > ANY(SELECT col_item ...)  <==> val > (SELECT MIN(col_item) ...);
val >= ANY(SELECT col_item ...) <==> val >= (SELECT MIN(col_item) ...);
val < ANY(SELECT col_item ...)  <==> val < (SELECT MAX(col_item) ...);
val <= ANY(SELECT col_item ...) <==> val <= (SELECT MAX(col_item) ...);
```

After the subquery is converted to contain `MAX` or `MIN`, you can further rewrite `MAX` or `MIN` to reduce the number of scanning operations on the right-side table. Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient> SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 > ANY(SELECT c1 FROM t2);
<==>
obclient> SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 > (SELECT MIN(c1) FROM t2);
```

After the `MAX`/`MIN` rewrite, the primary key `t2.c1` can be used to directly push `LIMIT 1` down to `TABLE SCAN` to generate the `MIN` value. The execution plan is as follows:

```javascript
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 WHERE c1 > ANY(SELECT c1 FROM t2);

Query Plan:
 ===================================================
|ID|OPERATOR        |NAME          |EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------------------
|0 |SUBPLAN FILTER  |              |1        |73  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN     |t1            |1        |37  |
|2 | SCALAR GROUP BY|              |1        |37  |
|3 |  SUBPLAN SCAN  |subquery_table|1        |37  |
|4 |   TABLE SCAN   |t2            |1        |36  |
===================================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1]), filter([t1.c1 > ANY(subquery(1))]),
      exec_params_(nil), onetime_exprs_(nil), init_plan_idxs_([1])
  1 - output([t1.c1]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T_FUN_MIN(subquery_table.c1)]), filter(nil),
      group(nil), agg_func([T_FUN_MIN(subquery_table.c1)])
  3 - output([subquery_table.c1]), filter(nil),
      access([subquery_table.c1])
  4 - output([t2.c1]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c1]), partitions(p0),
      limit(1), offset(nil)
```

## Outer join elimination

Outer joins are classified into left outer joins, right outer joins, and full outer joins. The order of an outer join cannot be changed during the operation, the optimizer has limited options of join order. Outer join elimination helps convert an outer join into an inner join, providing the optimizer with more join path options.

However, the outer join elimination requires a "Reject-NULL" condition, which is contained in `WHERE` conditions, and exports `FALSE` when the right-side table generates a `NULL` value.

Here is an example:

```javascript
obclient>SELECT t1.c1, t2.c2 FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c2;
```

This is an outer join, whose output row `t2.c2` may be `NULL`. If you add the condition `t2.c2 > 5`, data is filtered by this condition, and the output of `t2.c1` cannot be `NULL`, so that the outer join can be converted into an inner join.

```javascript
obclient> SELECT t1.c1, t2.c2 FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c2 WHERE t2.c2 > 5;
<==>
obclient> SELECT t1.c1, t2.c2 FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.c2 = t2.c2
            WHERE t2.c2 > 5;
```

## Condition simplification

### HAVING condition elimination

If no aggregate or `GROUP BY` operation exists in the query, the `HAVING` condition can be merged into the `WHERE` conditions, with the `HAVING` condition eliminated. This way, the `HAVING` condition can be managed with other conditions in `WHERE` for further optimization.

```javascript
obclient>SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1 HAVING t1.c2 > 1;
<==>
obclient>SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1 AND t1.c2 > 1;
```

The rewritten plan is shown in the following example, where the condition `t1.c2 > 1` is pushed down to the `TABLE SCAN` layer.

```javascript
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c1 HAVING t1.c2 > 1;

Query Plan:
=========================================
|ID|OPERATOR        |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
-----------------------------------------
|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN|    |1        |59  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN     |t1  |1        |37  |
|2 | TABLE GET      |t2  |1        |36  |
=========================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil),
      conds(nil), nl_params_([t1.c1])
  1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter([t1.c2 > 1]),
      access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c1], [t2.c2]), partitions(p0)
```

### Equivalence relation deduction

In the process of equivalence relation deduction, new conditional expressions are deduced based on the transitivity of comparison operators to reduce the number of rows to be processed or to select a more efficient index.

OceanBase Database supports the deduction of equi-join conditions. For example, assume that a table contains columns `a` and `b`. `a ＝ b AND a > 1 AND b > 1` can be deduced from `a ＝ b AND a > 1`. In this case, if column `b` is indexed and selectivity of the index is low for the condition `b > 1`, the performance of accessing the table that contains column `b` can be significantly improved by using the deduced condition.

The following example shows that the condition `t1.c1 = t2.c2 AND t1.c1 > 2` is equivalently deduced to `t1.c1 = t2.c2 AND t1.c1 > 2 AND t2.c2 > 2`. You can learn from the plan that `t2.c2` is pushed down to `TABLE SCAN` and the corresponding index of `t2.c2` is applied.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT, c3 INT, KEY IDX_c2(c2));
Query OK, 0 rows affected
/*Run this command in MySQL mode*/

obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED_NOADDR SELECT t1.c1, t2.c2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 = t2.c2 AND t1.c1 > 2;

Query Plan:
==========================================
|ID|OPERATOR   |NAME      |EST. ROWS|COST|
------------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE JOIN |          |5        |78  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN|t2(IDX_c2)|5        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN|t1        |3        |37  |
==========================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([t1.c1 = t2.c2]), other_conds(nil)
  1 - output([t2.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c2]), partitions(p0),
      is_index_back=false,
      range_key([t2.c2], [t2.c1]), range(2,MAX ; MAX,MAX),
      range_cond([t2.c2 > 2])
  2 - output([t1.c1]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c1]), partitions(p0),
      is_index_back=false,
      range_key([t1.c1]), range(2 ; MAX),
      range_cond([t1.c1 > 2])
```

### Identically true/false elimination

The following identically true and false conditions can be eliminated:

* `false and expr` ＝ Identically false

* `true or expr` = Identically true

In the following example, for the condition `WHERE 0 > 1 AND c1 ＝ 3`, `AND` is identically false because of the condition `0 > 1`. Therefore, the result can be directly returned without the need to execute the SQL query, thereby accelerating the execution process.

```javascript
obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED_NOADDR SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE 0 > 1 AND c1 = 3;

Query Plan:
===================================
|ID|OPERATOR  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
-----------------------------------
|0 |TABLE SCAN|t1  |0        |38  |
===================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter([0], [t1.c1 = 3]), startup_filter([0]),
      access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0),
      is_index_back=false, filter_before_indexback[false,false],
      range_key([t1.__pk_increment], [t1.__pk_cluster_id], [t1.__pk_partition_id]),
      range(MAX,MAX,MAX ; MIN,MIN,MIN)always false
```

## Non-SPJ rewrite

### Sorting redundancy elimination

Redundancy elimination for sorting removes redundant ordered items to reduce resource consumption for sorting. Redundancy elimination for sorting is required in the following three circumstances:

* Duplicate columns in the `ORDER BY` expression list. You can sort the columns after deduplication.

   ```javascript
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 5 ORDER BY c1, c1, c2, c3 ;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 5 ORDER BY c1, c2, c3;
   ```

* A single-valued column in both `ORDER BY` and `WHERE`. This column can be deleted before sorting.

   ```javascript
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 5 ORDER BY c1, c2, c3;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1 WHERE c2 = 5 ORDER BY c1, c3;
   ```

* If a query at the current layer contains `ORDER BY` but not `LIMIT`, and the query resides in the set operation of the parent query, then `ORDER BY` can be eliminated. The reason is that the `UNION` operation on two ordered sets simply leads to an unordered result set. However, if `ORDER BY` contains `LIMIT`, which semantically implies the selection of the greatest or smallest N items, `ORDER BY` must be retained to avoid semantic errors.

   ```javascript
   obclient> (SELECT c1,c2 FROM t1 ORDER BY c1) UNION (SELECT c3,c4 FROM t2 ORDER BY c3);
   <==>
   obclient> (SELECT c1,c2 FROM t1) UNION (SELECT c3,c4 FROM t2);
   ```

### LIMIT pushdown to subquery

`LIMIT` pushdown rewrite means to push the `LIMIT` down to the subquery. OceanBase Database supports pushing down `LIMIT` to a view (Example 1) or to a subquery that contains the `UNION` operator (Example 2), without changing the semantics.

Example 1: Push `LIMIT` down to the view.

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY c1) a LIMIT 1;
<==>
obclient> SELECT * FROM (SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY c1 LIMIT 1) a LIMIT 1;
```

Example 2: Push `LIMIT` down to the subquery corresponding to `UNION`.

```sql
obclient> (SELECT c1,c2 FROM t1) UNION ALL (SELECT c3,c4 FROM t2) LIMIT 5;
<==>
obclient> (SELECT c1,c2 FROM t1 LIMIT 5) UNION ALL (SELECT c3,c4 FROM t2 limit 5) LIMIT 5;
```

### LIMIT pushdown to outer join or cross join

If an SQL statement does not contain the `WINDOW FUNCTION`, `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`, or `HAVING` clause and does not contain the `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` condition or the `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` condition is related only to one side of the join, you can push down the `LIMIT` statement to one side (outer join) or multiple sides (cross join) of the joined table. This rewrite method is called `LIMIT` pushdown to outer join or cross join. Pushdown of the `LIMIT` statement can effectively reduce the number of rows that are joined, thus reducing the overheads of queries.

When the `LIMIT` statement is pushed down for an outer join, a view is encapsulated on the table pushed down. The following example shows query Q1 for a left outer join:

```sql
Q1:
SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 LIMIT 1;
==>
Q2:
SELECT * FROM V LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.c1 = t2.c1 LIMIT 1;
V: (SELECT * FROM t1 LIMIT 1);
```

Query Q1 does not contain the preceding clauses or the `WHERE` or `ORDER BY` condition. Therefore, view `V` can be encapsulated on table `t1` on the left side, and `LIMIT 1` can be encapsulated into view `V`, thus rewriting query Q1 into query Q2. After the `LIMIT` statement is pushed down, the original `LIMIT` statement must be retained. The execution plan is rewritten as follows:

```sql
=============================================
|ID|OPERATOR         |NAME   |EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------------
|0 |LIMIT            |       |1        |4   |
|1 | MERGE OUTER JOIN|       |1        |4   |
|2 |  SUBPLAN SCAN   |VIEW1  |1        |2   |
|3 |   TABLE SCAN    |t1(idx)|1        |2   |
|4 |  SORT           |       |1        |2   |
|5 |   TABLE SCAN    |t2     |1        |2   |
=============================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
0 - output([1]), filter(nil), rowset=256, limit(1), offset(nil)
1 - output(nil), filter(nil), rowset=256,
equal_conds([VIEW1.t1.c1 = t2.c1]), other_conds(nil)
2 - output([VIEW1.t1.c1]), filter(nil), rowset=256,
access([VIEW1.t1.c1])
3 - output([t1.c1]), filter(nil), rowset=256,
access([t1.c1]), partitions(p0),
limit(1), offset(nil)
4 - output([t2.c1]), filter(nil), rowset=256, sort_keys([t2.c1, ASC])
5 - output([t2.c1]), filter(nil), rowset=256,
access([t2.c1]), partitions(p0)
```

Likewise, a right outer join can push down the `LIMIT` statement to the table on the right side when the preceding conditions are met.

A cross join can push down the `LIMIT` statement to both sides. Here is an example:

```sql
Q3:
SELECT 1 FROM t1, t2 WHERE t1.c1 > 0 ORDER BY t1.c1 LIMIT 1;
==>
Q4:
SELECT 1 FROM V1, V2 LIMIT 1;
V1: SELECT 1 FROM t1 WHERE t1.c1 > 0 ORDER BY t1.c1 LIMIT 1;
V2: SELECT 1 FROM t2 LIMIT 1;
```

Query Q3 does not contain the conditions in the `LIMIT` pushdown to outer join and contains only the `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` conditions applied to table `t1`. In this case, you can create views `V1` and `V2` on tables `t1` and `t2`, respectively. Then, you can push down the `LIMIT` statement to the views, thus rewriting query Q3 into query Q4. The execution plan is rewritten as follows:

```sql

|ID|OPERATOR                   |NAME |EST. ROWS|COST|

|7 |    TABLE SCAN             |t2   |1        |2   |

  7 - output([1]), filter([t2.c1 > 0]), rowset=256,
      access([t2.c1]), partitions(p0),
      limit(1), offset(nil)
```

An SQL query for a multi-table join that meets the preceding conditions can execute `LIMIT` pushdown to outer joins and cross joins multiple times to increase the room for query rewrite and achieve better rewrite results.


### DISTINCT elimination

* If the `SELECT` statement contains only constants, `DISTINCT` can be eliminated, with `LIMIT 1` added.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT DISTINCT 1,2 FROM t1 ;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT 1,2 FROM t1 LIMIT 1;

   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED_NOADDR SELECT DISTINCT 1,2 FROM t1;

   Query Plan:
   ===================================
   |ID|OPERATOR  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
   -----------------------------------
   |0 |TABLE SCAN|t1  |1        |36  |
   ===================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([1], [2]), filter(nil),
         access([t1.c1]), partitions(p0),
         limit(1), offset(nil),
         is_index_back=false,
         range_key([t1.c1]), range(MIN ; MAX)always true
   ```

* `DISTINCT` can be eliminated if the `SELECT` statement contains a column that ensures uniqueness. In the following example, `(c1, c2)` is the primary key. It ensures the uniqueness of `c1`, `c2`, and `c3`. Therefore, `DISTINCT` can be eliminated.

   ```javascript
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT, c2 INT, c3 INT, PRIMARY KEY(c1, c2));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2, c3 FROM t2;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT c1, c2 c3 FROM t2;

   obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT DISTINCT c1, c2, c3 FROM t2;

   Query Plan:
   ===================================
   |ID|OPERATOR  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
   -----------------------------------
   |0 |TABLE SCAN|t2  |1000     |455 |
   ===================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), filter(nil),
         access([t2.c1], [t2.c2], [t2.c3]), partitions(p0)
   ```

### MIN/MAX rewrite

* If the `MIN` or `MAX` function contains a parameter serving as the index prefix column and does not contain `GROUP BY`, `SCALAR aggregate` can be rewritten into an index scan for scanning only one row, as shown in the following example:

   ```javascript
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT, c3 INT, KEY IDX_c2_c3(c2,c3));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SELECT MIN(c2) FROM t1;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT MIN(c2) FROM (SELECT c2 FROM t2 ORDER BY c2 LIMIT 1) AS t;

   obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT MIN(c2) FROM t1;

   Query Plan:
   ==================================================
   |ID|OPERATOR       |NAME          |EST. ROWS|COST|
   --------------------------------------------------
   |0 |SCALAR GROUP BY|              |1        |37  |
   |1 | SUBPLAN SCAN  |subquery_table|1        |37  |
   |2 |  TABLE SCAN   |t1(idx_c2_c3) |1        |36  |
   ==================================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([T_FUN_MIN(subquery_table.c2)]), filter(nil),
         group(nil), agg_func([T_FUN_MIN(subquery_table.c2)])
     1 - output([subquery_table.c2]), filter(nil),
         access([subquery_table.c2])
     2 - output([t1.c2]), filter([(T_OP_IS_NOT, t1.c2, NULL, 0)]),
         access([t1.c2]), partitions(p0),
         limit(1), offset(nil)
   ```

* If all parameters of `SELECT MIN` or `SELECT MAX` are constants and `GROUP BY` is contained, you can rewrite `MIN` or `MAX` to a constant to reduce the resource consumption of the `MIN` or `MAX` operation.

   ```javascript
   obclient> SELECT MAX(1) FROM t1 GROUP BY c1;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT 1 FROM t1 GROUP BY c1;

   obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED_NOADDR SELECT MAX(1) FROM t1 GROUP BY c1;

   Query Plan:
   ===================================
   |ID|OPERATOR  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
   -----------------------------------
   |0 |TABLE SCAN|t1  |1000     |411 |
   ===================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([1]), filter(nil),
         access([t1.c1]), partitions(p0),
         is_index_back=false,
         range_key([t1.c1]), range(MIN ; MAX)always true
   ```

* If all parameters of `SELECT MIN` or `SELECT MAX` are constants and `GROUP BY` is not contained, you can rewrite the query to scan only one row by using the index, as shown in the following example:

   ```javascript
   obclient> SELECT MAX(1) FROM t1;
   <==>
   obclient> SELECT MAX(t.a) FROM (SELECT 1 AS a FROM t1 LIMIT 1) t;

   obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED_NOADDR SELECT MAX(1) FROM t1;

   Query Plan:
   ==================================================
   |ID|OPERATOR       |NAME          |EST. ROWS|COST|
   --------------------------------------------------
   |0 |SCALAR GROUP BY|              |1        |37  |
   |1 | SUBPLAN SCAN  |subquery_table|1        |37  |
   |2 |  TABLE SCAN   |t1            |1        |36  |
   ==================================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
     0 - output([T_FUN_MAX(subquery_table.subquery_col_alias)]), filter(nil),
         group(nil), agg_func([T_FUN_MAX(subquery_table.subquery_col_alias)])
     1 - output([subquery_table.subquery_col_alias]), filter(nil),
         access([subquery_table.subquery_col_alias])
     2 - output([1]), filter(nil),
         access([t1.c1]), partitions(p0),
         limit(1), offset(nil),
         is_index_back=false,
         range_key([t1.c1]), range(MIN ; MAX)always true
   ```
