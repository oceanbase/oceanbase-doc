# UNION

`UNION` operators perform union set operations on the output of two queries.

OceanBase Database supports the following types of `UNION` operators: `UNION ALL`, `HASH UNION DISTINCT`, and `MERGE UNION DISTINCT`.

## UNION ALL

The `UNION ALL` operator directly merges the output of two queries.

In the following example, Q1 joins the two queries with `UNION ALL`, which performs a union set operation on their output. During execution, the operator sequentially generates the output of the left and right subnodes.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1,1);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2,2);
Query OK, 1 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 UNION ALL SELECT c2 FROM t1;

Query Plan:
====================================
|ID|OPERATOR   |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
------------------------------------
|0 |UNION ALL  |    |4        |74  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN|T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN|T1  |2        |37  |
====================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([UNION(T1.C1, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `UNION ALL` operator.

| **Field** | **Description** |
|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `UNION ALL` operator.  |

## MERGE UNION DISTINCT

The `MERGE UNION DISTINCT` operator performs a union set operation on the output of queries and deduplicates the result.

In the following example, Q2 joins the two queries with `UNION DISTINCT`. Since `c1` is sorted, the `MERGE UNION DISTINCT` operator is used as Operator 0 to find the union set and deduplicate the result. `c2` is not sorted, so a `SORT` operator is assigned before Operator 3 for sorting. When the operator is executed, it reads the sorted output from the left and right subnodes, merges them to generate a sorted output, and deduplicates the output.

```sql
Q2:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c1 FROM t1 UNION SELECT c2 FROM t1;

Query Plan:
=============================================
|ID|OPERATOR            |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
---------------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE UNION DISTINCT|    |4        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN         |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | SORT               |    |2        |39  |
|3 |  TABLE SCAN        |T1  |2        |37  |
=============================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([UNION(T1.C1, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  3 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `MERGE UNION DISTINCT` operator. The fields of the `MERGE UNION DISTINCT` operator have the same meaning as those of the `UNION ALL` operator.

## HASH UNION DISTINCT

The `HASH UNION DISTINCT` operator performs a union set operation on the output of queries and deduplicates the result.

In the following example, Q3 uses `UNION DISTINCT` to join the two queries, the columns are unsorted, and the `HASH UNION DISTINCT` operator is used as Operator 0 to find the union set and deduplicate the result. When the operator is executed, it reads the output from the left and right subnodes, creates a hash table, deduplicates the data, and outputs the result.

```sql
Q3:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT c2 FROM t1 UNION SELECT c2 FROM t1;

Query Plan:
============================================
|ID|OPERATOR           |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
--------------------------------------------
|0 |HASH UNION DISTINCT|    |4        |77  |
|1 | TABLE SCAN        |T1  |2        |37  |
|2 | TABLE SCAN        |T1  |2        |37  |
============================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([UNION(T1.C2, T1.C2)]), filter(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `HASH UNION DISTINCT` operator. The fields of the operator have the same meaning as those of the `UNION ALL` operator.
