# EXCHANGE

`EXCHANGE` operators exchange data between threads.

`EXCHANGE` operators are useful in distributed scenarios and usually appear in pairs, with an `EXCHANGE OUT` operator at the source side and an `EXCHANGE IN` operator at the destination side.

## EXCH-IN/OUT

Short for `EXCHANGE IN/EXCHANGE OUT`, the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators aggregate data from multiple partitions and send them to the leader node involved in the query.

In the following example, the query accesses five partitions: `p0, p1, p2, p3, and p4`. Operator 1 receives the output of Operator 2 and sends the data out. Operator 0 receives the output of Operator 1 from multiple partitions, aggregates them, and generates the result.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t15 (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 5;
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t15;

```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators.

| Field | Description |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PX COORDINATOR | A special type of `EXCHANGE IN` operator, responsible for not only pulling back remote data, but also scheduling the execution of sub-plans. |
| Output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators.  |

## EXCH-IN/OUT (REMOTE)

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (REMOTE)` operators pull remote data in a single partition back to the local server.

As shown in the following example, a non-partitioned table is created on Server A, and a query is executed on Server B to read data from that table. In this case, the operators 0 and 1 are assigned to the execution plan to fetch remote data. Operator 1 is executed on Server A to read the data from table `t14` and send the data out. Operator 0 is executed on Server B to receive the output of Operator 1.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t14 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t14;
+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT (REMOTE)` operators. The fields of the operator have the same meaning as those of the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators.

## EXCH-IN/OUT (PKEY)

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (PKEY)` operators repartition data. They are generally used with a binary operator pair to repartition the data of one subnode by following the partitioning method of the other subnode.

In the following example, the query is to join two partitioned tables. The execution plan repartitions the data of table `s15` by following the partitioning method of table `t13`. The input of Operator 4 is the scanning result of table `s15`. For every row of table `s15`, the operator determines its target node based on the partitioning of table `t13` and the join condition of the query.

In addition, Operator 3 is `EXCHANGE IN MERGE SORT DISTR`, a special `EXCHANGE IN` operator that performs merge and sort operations when aggregating data from multiple partitions. In this execution plan, data received by Operator 3 from all partitions is sorted by `c1`, so the operator merges and sorts the received data to ensure that the output is also sorted by `c1`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t13 (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 5;
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> CREATE TABLE s15 (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM s15, t13 WHERE s15.c1 = t13.c1;

```

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT (PKEY)` operators.

| Field | Description |
|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PX COORDINATOR | A special type of `EXCHANGE IN` operator, responsible for not only pulling back remote data, but also scheduling the execution of sub-plans. |
| Output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `EXCH-IN/OUT (PKEY)` operators.  |
| pkey | The column based on which the repartitioning is performed. For example, `#keys=1, [s15.c1]` indicates that the repartitioning is performed based on column `c1`.  |

## EXCH-IN/OUT (HASH)

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (HASH)` operators repartition data by using a set of hash functions.

In the execution plan shown in the following example, operators 3-5 and 7-8 are two sets of `EXCHANGE` operators that use hash functions for repartitioning. These two sets of operators partition the data of tables `t12` and `s14` into multiple parts based on a new set of hash functions. In the example, the columns `t12.c2` and `s14.c2` are taken for the hash operation to ensure that rows with the same value in column `c2` are grouped in the same part. Based on the repartitioned data, Operator 2 `HASH JOIN` merges all parts based on the condition `t12.c2= s14.c2`.

Additionally, the plan shows `dop = 2` because the query is executed with a degree of parallelism (DOP) of 2.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t12 (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> CREATE TABLE s14 (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+PARALLEL(2) LEADING(t12 s14) USE_HASH(s14) PQ_DISTRIBUTE(s14 HASH HASH)*/ * FROM t12, s14 WHERE t12.c2 = s14.c2;

The `PX PARTITION ITERATO` operator iterates data at the partition level. For more information, see [GI](../200.execution-plan-operator/2400.GI.md).

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT (HASH)` operators.

| Field | Description |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PX COORDINATOR | A special type of `EXCHANGE IN` operator, responsible for not only pulling back remote data, but also scheduling the execution of sub-plans. |
| Output | The output expressions of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator. In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the `EXCH-IN/OUT (HASH)` operators.  |
| pkey | The column based on which the hash repartitioning is performed. For example, `#keys=1, [s14.c2]` indicates that the hash repartitioning is performed based on column `c2`.  |

## EXCH-IN/OUT (BC2HOST)

The `EXCH-IN/OUT (BC2HOST)` operators repartition input data by using the `BC2HOST` method and broadcasts the data to other threads.

In the execution plan shown in the following example, the operators 3 and 4 are `EXCHANGE` operators that use `BC2HOST` repartitioning. They broadcast the data of table `t11` to every thread and try to join each partition of table `s13` with the broadcast data of table `t11`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t11 (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE s13 (c1 INT, c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected 

obclient> INSERT INTO s VALUES (1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4);
Query OK, 1 rows affected 

obclient> EXPALIN SELECT  /*+PARALLEL(2) */ * FROM t11, s13 WHERE t11.c2 = s13.c2;

In the preceding example, the `Outputs & filters` section shows in detail the output information of the `EXCH-IN/OUT (BC2HOST)` operators. The fields of the operators have the same meaning as those of the `EXCH-IN/OUT` operators.
