# Introduction to SQL execution plans

An execution plan describes the process of executing an SQL query statement in OceanBase Database. You can execute the `EXPLAIN` statement to view the logical execution plan generated by the optimizer for a given SQL statement.

To analyze the performance of an SQL statement, you need to first check the SQL execution plan to see if any error exists. Therefore, understanding the execution plan is the first step for SQL tuning, and knowledge about operators of an execution plan is key to understanding the `EXPLAIN` statement.

## Syntax of the EXPLAIN statement

OceanBase Database supports three EXPLAIN modes: `EXPLAIN BASIC`, `EXPLAIN`, and `EXPLAIN EXTENDED`. They demonstrate details of execution plans at different levels:

* The `EXPLAIN BASIC` statement shows the most basic framework of a plan.

* The `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` statement extends a plan to its full frame with the most details and is usually used in troubleshooting.

* The `EXPLAIN` statement shows information to the extent that helps users understand the entire execution process of a plan.

The syntax of the `EXPLAIN` statement is as follows:

```sql
EXPLAIN [INTO table_name ] [SET statement_id = string] [explain_type] [PRETTY | PRETTY_COLOR] dml_statement;

explain_type:
    BASIC
  | OUTLINE
  | EXTENDED
  | EXTENDED_NOADDR
  | PARTITIONS
  | FORMAT = {TRADITIONAL| JSON}

dml_statement:
    SELECT statement
  | DELETE statement
  | INSERT statement
  | UPDATE statement
  /* Supported only in Oracle mode */
  | MERGE statement
  /* Supported only in MySQL mode */
  | REPLACE statement
```

The `EXPLAIN` statement applies to the `SELECT`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE`, and `UPDATE` statements. It shows information about statement execution plans provided by the optimizer, including the method of processing the statement and the method and sequence of joining tables.

You can use the `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` statement to display the scan range of the table and use the `EXPLAIN OUTLINE` statement to display the outline information.

The `FORMAT` option is used to specify the output format. The `TRADITIONAL` value is the default value and specifies to display information in a table. The `JSON` value specifies to display information in a `JSON` file.

You can use the `EXPLAIN PARTITIONS` statement to check queries related to partitioned tables. If you check queries for non-partitioned tables, no error is returned, but the values in the `PARTITIONS` column are always `NULL`.

You can use `INTO table_name` to save the execution plan obtained by `EXPLAIN` to a specified table. By default, the plan is saved to the `PLAN_TABLE` table. You can use `SET statement_id` to set an ID for the current query, so that the execution plan of the SQL query can be obtained based on the ID when necessary. By default, an empty string is used as the ID. For more information, see [EXPLAIN](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/600.sql-statement-of-mysql-mode/5300.explain-of-mysql-mode.md).

For complex execution plans, you can use the `PRETTY` or `PRETTY_COLOR` option to connect the parent and child nodes in the plan tree with tree lines or colored tree lines, so that the execution plan is easier to read. Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE p1table(c1 INT ,c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE p2table(c1 INT ,c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED PRETTY_COLOR SELECT  * FROM p1table p1 JOIN p2table p2 ON p1.c1=p2.c2;
*************************** 1. row ***************************

## Shape and operators of a plan

In a database system, an execution plan is usually represented in a tree-like structure. However, different databases display execution plans in different ways.

The following examples show the execution plans for TPC-DS Q3 in PostgreSQL, Oracle, and OceanBase Database.

```sql
obclient> SELECT /*TPC-DS Q3*/ *
     FROM (SELECT dt.d_year,
                  item.i_brand_id    brand_id,
                  item.i_brand       brand,
                  Sum(ss_net_profit) sum_agg
           FROM   date_dim dt,
                  store_sales,
                  item
           WHERE  dt.d_date_sk = store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk
                  AND store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk
                  AND item.i_manufact_id = 914
                  AND dt.d_moy = 11
           GROUP  BY dt.d_year,
                     item.i_brand,
                     item.i_brand_id
           ORDER  BY dt.d_year,
                     sum_agg DESC,
                     brand_id)
     WHERE ROWNUM <= 100;
```

* The execution plan in PostgreSQL is as follows:

   ```sql

You may notice from the foregoing examples that a plan in OceanBase Database is similar to that in Oracle Database.

The following table describes columns of an execution plan in OceanBase Database.

| Column name | Description |
|-------------|----------------------------|
| `ID` | The sequence number of the execution tree obtained by using preorder traversal, starting from 0.  |
| `OPERATOR` | The name of the operator.  |
| `NAME` | The name of the table or index corresponding to a table operation.  |
| `EST. ROWS` | The estimated number of output rows of the operator.  |
| `COST` | The execution cost of the operator, in microseconds.  |

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>In a table operation, the <code>NAME</code> field displays names (aliases) of tables involved in the operation. In the case of index access, the name of the index is displayed in parentheses after the table name. For example, <code>t1(t1_c2)</code> indicates that index <code>t1_c2</code> is used. In the case of reverse scanning, the keyword <code>REVERSE</code> is added after the index name, with the index name and the keyword <code>REVERSE</code> separated with a comma (,), for example, <code>t1(t1_c2,REVERSE)</code>. </p>
  </main>

In OceanBase Database, the first part of the output of `EXPLAIN` is the tree structure of the execution plan. The hierarchy of operations in the tree is represented by their indentations in the `operator` column. Operators at the deepest level are executed first. Operators at the same level are executed in the specified execution order.

The following figure shows the execution plan tree for TPC-DS Q3.

![p181620](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V4.0.0/sql-execution-plan-1.png)

In OceanBase Database, the second part of the output of `EXPLAIN` contains the details of each operator, including the output expression, filter conditions, partition information, and unique information of each operator, such as the sort keys, join keys, and pushdown conditions. Here is an example:

```sql
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([t1.c1, ASC], [t1.c2, ASC]), prefix_pos(1)
  1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([t1.c1 = t2.c2]), other_conds(nil)
  2 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([t2.c2, ASC])
  3 - output([t2.c2], [t2.c1]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c2], [t2.c1]), partitions(p0)
  4 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0)
```
