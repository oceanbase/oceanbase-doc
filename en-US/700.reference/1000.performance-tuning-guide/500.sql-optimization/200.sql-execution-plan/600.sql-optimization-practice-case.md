# SQL optimization practice with EXPLAIN

A customer encountered a performance failure in its database system where a large number of transactions were congested. The direct cause was that CPU utilization reaches 100% on some OBServer nodes, which means that transactions cannot be processed normally. Based on the analysis of the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view, a problematic SQL query with average execution time of 2s was located. Besides, the SQL query used over 70% of the CPU resources on the OBServer node. Then, the cause was determined based on the `EXPLAIN` plan (query execution plan) and DDL definitions of related tables and views, and the CPU time consumed by the SQL query was reduced to 4 ms through a series of DDL optimization measures. The performance bottleneck problem was completely solved. 

## Logic of troubleshooting

The troubleshooting logic in this case is as follows:

1. Locate the top SQL queries by querying the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view. 

   Execute the following SQL statement to query the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view and locate the problematic SQL queries. For this case, the information to query is the ratio of the CPU utilization of SQL queries (`GROUP BY sql_id`) on the specified OBServer node (`svr_ip`) to the total CPU time in 30 minutes before the problem occurred. The formula that calculates the ratio is `SUM(execute_time)/(30*60*1000*1000)AS cpu_cnt`. 

   ```shell
   SELECT sql_id,
          COUNT(*)               AS executions,
          SUM(execute_time)      AS tot_cpu_time,
          AVG(execute_time)      AS avg_cpu_time,
          SUM(execute_time)/(30*60*1000*1000)     AS cpu_cnt,
          query_sql
       FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT
       WHERE tenant_id= 'mysql001'
           AND svr_ip='xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx'
           AND request_time BETWEEN (TIME_TO_USEC(NOW())-30*60*1000*1000) AND TIME_TO_USEC(NOW())
           AND is_executor_rpc =0
           GROUP BY sql_id
           HAVING COUNT(*)>1
           ORDER BY cpu_cnt DESC LIMIT 10;
   ```

   The result shows that the execution frequency and CPU utilization of `SELECT ... FROM V_TT01 WHERE (COL001 IN (...))` SQL queries are relatively high. Their CPU utilization reaches about 70% (80 CPU cores/108 CPU cores) on the same OBServer node.

2. Query the `EXPLAIN` plan of a problematic SQL query and analyze the key points that affect performance. 

   Execute the `EXPLAIN` statement to obtain the `EXPLAIN` plan of the first problematic SQL query.

   ```

   The preceding `EXPALIN` plan shows that the total execution cost of the SQL query is estimated to be 432961. The largest portion, which is 397629, is consumed by Operator 3 `UNION ALL`. Both branches of the `UNION ALL` operator contain the `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator that is executed at the estimated cost of 151990 and 236327 respectively. In the first branch (operators 4 to 11) of the `UNION ALL` operator, the cost is mainly consumed by Operator 11, that is, the `TABLE SCAN` operation based on the `TBL3(IDX_TBL3_COL170)` index. In the second branch (operators 12 to 14), the cost is mainly consumed by Operator 14, which is also the `TABLE SCAN` operation based on the `TBL3(IDX_TBL3_COL170)` index. Therefore, we can see that the high cost of operators 11 and 14 may be caused by the `TBL3` index. That is, this index may be a performance bottleneck in this case. 

   Then, we can analyze the `Outputs & filters` information of operators 11 and 14. `range(MIN,MIN ; MAX,MAX)always true` indicates that index matching was not performed, while `filter([20017476 = cast(cast(TBL3.COL170(0x7f0cb0ffa210), VARCHAR2(20 BYTE))(0x7f0cb1002fa0), NUMBER(-1, -85))(0x7f0cb1002770)(0x7f0cb1001c70)])` indicates that data type conversion occurred during table access. We can infer that the data types of associated fields may be inconsistent and data type conversion has been performed, resulting in an index matching failure on `TBL3.COL170`. Make further analysis based on this conclusion and DDL definitions. 

   ```sql
    11 - output(......), filter([20017476 = cast(cast(TBL3.COL170(0x7f3f5b51c090), VARCHAR2(20 BYTE))(0x7f3f5b51d6b0), NUMBER(-1, -85))(0x7f3f5b51ce80)(0x7f3f5b51c380)]),
         access(......), partitions(p0),
         is_index_back=false, filter_before_indexback[false],   
         range_key([TBL3.COL170(0x7f3f5b51c090)], [TBL3.COL002(0x7f3f5b528e80)]), range(MIN,MIN ; MAX,MAX)always true

         access(......), partitions(p0),
         is_index_back=true, filter_before_indexback[true],
         range_key([TBL3.COL170(0x7f0cb0ffa210)], [TBL3.COL002(0x7f3f5b582c10)]), range(MIN,MIN ; MAX,MAX)always true
   ```

3. Determine the cause of the performance issue by analyzing the DDL definitions of related tables and views. 

   The definition of the `V_TT01` view shows that `TBL3` in the first branch of `UNION ALL` exists in the `NOT EXISTS` subquery. According to the `EXPLAIN` plan, the relevant subquery is rewritten as `NESTED-LOOP ANTI JOIN`. In addition, `TO_NUMBER` conversion has occurred in the `V_TT01` view, where `COL001` and `COL004` are passed to the `(IDX_TBL3_COL170)` index of `TBL3` through `COL170`. 

   Analysis on the `TBL3` table definition shows that the `TBL3(IDX_TBL3_COL170)` index is defined upon the `COL170` field whose data type is `VARCHAR2(20)`. This field is the field that the `V_TT01` view associates with other tables. The definition of the `V_TT01` view shows that, in the first branch of `UNION ALL`, the association corresponding to Operator 11 is `"tbl3"."col170" = "tt01"."col001" = 20017476`, and the association corresponding to Operator 14 in the second branch is `"tbl3"."col170" = "tbl2"."col004" = 20017476`. Due to the inconsistent data types of the associated fields, `TO_NUMBER` conversion occurs, that is, the `VARCHAR2` type of the `COL170` field is forcibly converted to `NUMBER`. This is consistent with the `filter` information of operators 11 and 14 in `Outputs & filters`. 

   Based on the DDL definition and `EXPALIN` plan, we can see that during the execution of this type of SQL queries, the unreasonable forcible `TO_NUMBER` conversion in the `V_TT01` view causes a decrease in index performance, resulting in a high cost estimate for operators 11 and 14. The `TO_NUMBER` conversion must be removed.

   ```

## Logic of optimization

The DDL optimization logic for tables and views in this case is as follows:


* Remove the `TO_NUMBER` conversion in the view. The optimizer chooses a better join order, reducing the SQL response time (RT) from 2s to 150 ms. (The input data type of the view is `NUMBER`, and `COL001` in the view is also of the `NUMBER` type in the original table. Therefore, the forcible `TO_NUMBER` conversion in the view is redundant.) 
* The data types of all associated fields in the tables and views are defined as `NUMBER(20)` to avoid data type conversion. Then, index matching can be performed for `TBL3(IDX_TBL3_COL170)`. The SQL RT is further reduced to 20 ms. (Since the data type of `TBL3.COL170` is `VARCHAR`, when the query condition `COL001 IN ( value,value,...)` is passed to `TBL3.COL170`, data type conversion from `VARCHAR` to `NUMBER` occurs, and the index on `TBL3.COL170` cannot be used for matching.) 
* Reconstruct the partitions of the four associated tables in the view and add the tables to the same table group. This view serves as the business query entry. Previously, SQL queries accessing this view occupied all computing resources on a small part of OBServer nodes. To prevent this hot view from becoming a bottleneck again, reconstruct the partitions to distribute the query pressure on the view to more OBServer nodes. That is, hash partition the four associated tables in the view by taking the key for association as the partitioning key, and add the tables to the same table group to avoid cross-node queries. After reconstruction, the SQL RT is further reduced to 4 ms. 

The optimized SQL query has the following `EXPLAIN` plan. `PX PARTITION ITERATOR` indicates that `UNION ALL` is executed only in a partition. In this case, the cost of indexing on `TBL3` is low and the performance is greatly improved.
