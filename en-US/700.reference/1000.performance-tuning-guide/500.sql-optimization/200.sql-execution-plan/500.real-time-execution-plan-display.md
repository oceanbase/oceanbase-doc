# Real-time execution plan display

OceanBase Database can display the logical and physical execution plans of SQL statements.

You can use the `DBMS_XPLAN` system package of OceanBase Database to query logical execution plans. You can query the `(G)V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN` view for the physical execution plan of an SQL statement in the plan cache, and the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view for information about tenant-level execution plans.

## Query a logical execution plan

When you execute a large SQL query, if the current session is running for a long time, you may need to know the execution status of the query, such as the execution plan and execution process. In this case, because the current session is occupied by the large SQL query, you need to initiate a new session to locate the session of the large SQL query by using the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` statement, and then use the obtained `session_id` and the `DISPLAY_ACTIVE_SESSION_PLAN` function in the `DBMS_XPLAN` system package to show the execution details of the large SQL query.

The following example shows how to use the `DBMS_XPLAN` system package to query logical execution plans.

1. Connect to the database and execute a slow SQL query.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM TABLE(GENERATOR(100000)) A, TABLE(GENERATOR(10000))B;   
   +------------+
   | COUNT(*)   |
   +------------+
   | 1000000000 |
   +------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

2. Initiate another session and execute the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` statement to obtain the ID of the session running the slow SQL query.

   ```shell
   obclient> SHOW PROCESSLIST;
   +------------+------+--------------------+------+---------+------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | ID         | USER | HOST               | DB   | COMMAND | TIME | STATE  | INFO                                                                      |
   +------------+------+--------------------+------+---------+------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | 3221675847 | SYS  | 11.x.x.44:57841 | SYS  | Query   |    0 | ACTIVE | show processlist                                                          |
   | 3221668463 | SYS  | 11.x.x.44:57530 | SYS  | Query   |    2 | ACTIVE | select count(*) from table(generator(100000)) A, table(generator(10000))B |
   +------------+------+--------------------+------+---------+------+--------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ```

3. Use the `DBMS_XPLAN` system package to show the active execution plan in the specified session.

   ```shell
   /* Show the active execution plan in the session in MySQL mode. */
   obclient> SELECT DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY_ACTIVE_SESSION_PLAN(3221668463);

You can also use the `GV$OB_SQL_PLAN` (or `V$OB_SQL_PLAN`) view to query the execution plans of the current tenant on all OBServer nodes (or the current OBServer node). However, we recommend that you use the `DBMS_XPLAN` system package to view the execution plans.

The syntax for querying the `GV$OB_SQL_PLAN` view is as follows:

```sql
VIEW_DEFINITION='SELECT * FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQL_PLAN WHERE TENANT_ID = effective_tenant_id()'
```

The syntax for querying the `V$OB_SQL_PLAN` view is as follows:

```sql
VIEW_DEFINITION='SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_SQL_PLAN WHERE SVR_IP=host_ip() AND SVR_PORT=rpc_port()'
```

The following table describes the fields in the `(G)V$OB_SQL_PLAN` view.

| **Field** | **Description** |

## Query a physical execution plan

You can execute the `EXPLAIN` statement to demonstrate the execution plan generated by the current optimizer for an SQL query. However, changes in statistics and settings of user session variables may lead to differences between the return result of the `EXPLAIN` statement and the corresponding SQL plan in the plan cache. To determine the execution plans that are used by the SQL query, you must analyze the physical execution plans in the plan cache.

In OceanBase Database, the plan cache of each server is independent. You can access the `V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view to query the plan cache on the current server. You can provide the `tenant_id` and the SQL string to be queried (fuzzy matching supported) to obtain the corresponding `plan_id` of the SQL statement in the plan cache, and then display the physical execution plan of the SQL statement in the plan cache.

The syntax for querying the `V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN` view is as follows:

```sql
VIEW_DEFINITION='SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN WHERE TENANT_ID = tenant_id() AND PLAN_ID = plan_id()'
```

The following example shows how to query the `V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN` view for a physical execution plan.

1. Query the `V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view to obtain the `plan_id` of the SQL statement in the plan cache.

   ```shell

2. After you obtain `plan_id`, you can access the `V$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN` view to query information about the execution plan by using `tenant_id` and `plan_id`.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <p>The plan demonstrated here is a physical execution plan. Operator names in the plan may differ from those in the logical execution plan demonstrated by executing the <code>EXPLAIN</code> statement. </p>
   </main>

## Real-time SQL plan monitoring

Starting from V4.0, OceanBase Database supports real-time SQL plan monitoring. You can query the tenant-level `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view to obtain information about logical and physical execution plans, including the numbers of rows returned by operators, the start and end time of operators, and the execution status of operators in each execution thread.

The `OTHERSTAT_?_ID` and `OTHERSTAT_?_VALUE` fields in the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITORSQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view record operator-specific performance statistics. Currently, the view supports 10 such fields. The name of the statistics item that is recorded in each field is represented by an ID. You can query the `V$SQL_MONITOR_STATNAME` view to check the specific meaning corresponding to each ID.

```sql
obclient> DESC V$SQL_MONITOR_STATNAME;
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field       | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| CON_ID      | null         | NO   |     |         |       |
| ID          | bigint(20)   | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| GROUP_ID    | bigint(20)   | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| NAME        | varchar(40)  | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| DESCRIPTION | varchar(200) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| TYPE        | bigint(20)   | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
| FLAGS       | bigint(1)    | NO   |     |         |       |
+-------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
7 rows in set
```

The following example shows how to query execution plan information from the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` and `V$SQL_MONITOR_STATNAME` views.

1. Query the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view for `trace_id`.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT trace_id FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT WHERE query_sql like '%TPCH_%' ORDER BY REQUEST_TIME DESC LIMIT 1;
    +-----------------------------------+
    | trace_id                          |
    +-----------------------------------+
    | Y4C360A65A34F-0005A9BD39CF5C74    |
    +-----------------------------------+
    1 row in set
   ```

2. Query the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view for the execution plan summary or details.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT
        PROCESS_NAME,
        PLAN_LINE_ID,
        PLAN_OPERATION,
        COUNT(*) PARALLEL,
        AVG(LAST_REFRESH_TIME - FIRST_REFRESH_TIME) AVG_REFRESH_TIME,
        MAX(LAST_REFRESH_TIME - FIRST_REFRESH_TIME) MAX_REFRESH_TIME,
        MIN(LAST_REFRESH_TIME - FIRST_REFRESH_TIME) MIN_REFRESH_TIME,
        AVG(LAST_CHANGE_TIME - FIRST_CHANGE_TIME) AVG_CHANGE_TIME,
        MAX(LAST_CHANGE_TIME - FIRST_CHANGE_TIME) MAX_CHANGE_TIME,
        MIN(LAST_CHANGE_TIME - FIRST_CHANGE_TIME) MIN_CHANGE_TIME,
        SUM(OUTPUT_ROWS) TOTAL_OUTPUT_ROWS,
