# Differences between replace and insert_or_update

`replace` and `insert_or_update` are two operations that can be easily confused. In many cases, they may appear to have the same behavior externally, but their underlying semantics differ. This topic will provide a detailed explanation of the differences between the two.

`replace` represents an insertion operation. When conflicts occur, it deletes all rows causing conflicts and then performs the insertion.

`insert_or_update` also represents an insertion operation. However, when conflicts occur, it performs an update operation instead.

Let's illustrate the differences between the two with examples.

## insert_or_update

The `insert_or_update` operation provided by TableAPI is equivalent to a special SQL syntax. The following example shows how `insert_or_update` works:

```sql
OceanBase (root@test)> desc test_replace;
+-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| c1    | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| c2    | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| c3    | int(11) | YES  | UNI | NULL    |       |
+-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 |    5 |    6 |
+----+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.03 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> insert into test_replace (c1, c2, c3) values (4, 7, 8), (5, 8, 9) on duplicate key update c1=values(c1), c2=values(c2), c3=values(c3);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 1  Warnings: 0

OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 |    7 |    8 |
|  5 |    8 |    9 |
+----+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)
```

## replace

```sql
OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 |    7 |    8 |
|  5 |    8 |    9 |
+----+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> replace into test_replace (c1, c3) values (4, 9);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.04 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 | NULL |    9 |
+----+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

Based on the preceding examples, unlike `insert_or_update`, the `replace` operation deletes rows and changes the value of `c2` in the row where `c1` is `4` to the default value `NULL` because of the insertion of a new value. The `insert_or_update` operation does not perform these two special actions. In most cases, you need to use the `insert_or_update` operation, which is similar to the put method in NoSQL mode.

The two operations achieve the same results in the following two circumstances:

* The table only has the primary key but no unique indexes.

* The operation specifies the values of all columns in a row and the system does not need to insert the default value for columns where values are missing.

Although the results are the same in the preceding two circumstances, TableAPI optimizes the implementation of `insert_or_update` to provide better performance than that of replace.
