| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|--------------------|
| Type | String |
| Default value | other: 100,100,100 |
| Value range | N/A |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |


The percentages of each type of I/O requests of the tenant are specified in the following format: `category_name: min_percent, max_percent, weight_percent`. Settings for multiple types are separated by semicolons (`;`). Unspecified types are represented by `other`.

The sum of the `min_percent` fields of all types, and that of the `weight_percent` fields of all types, including the `other` type, are `100`.

The following example shows how to configure the percentages of each type of I/O requests for tenants:

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET io_category_config = 'user: 30, 90, 50; log: 30, 90, 30; sys: 10, 10, 10; other: 30, 100, 10;';
```
