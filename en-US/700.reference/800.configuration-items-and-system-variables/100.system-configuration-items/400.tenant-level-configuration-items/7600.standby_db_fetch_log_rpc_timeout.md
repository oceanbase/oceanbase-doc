# standby_db_fetch_log_rpc_timeout

`standby_db_fetch_log_rpc_timeout` specifies the timeout period of remote procedure call (RPC) requests sent by a standby cluster for pulling logs. If the specified timeout period is reached, the log transfer service of the standby cluster determines that the requested server in the primary cluster is unavailable and switches to another server.
