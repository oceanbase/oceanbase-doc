OceanBase Database supports progressive compactions on table data. After performing a DDL operation that needs to rewrite the data, OceanBase Database can distribute data rewriting to multiple compaction operations. During each compaction, only some of the data is rewritten. You can use the table-level attribute `progressive_merge_num` to control the compaction, or use the `default_progressive_merge_num` parameter to set the default number of progressive compactions when you create a table.

If you do not set the `progressive_merge_num` attribute, OceanBase Database sets its value to the value of `default_progressive_merge_num`.

The values of `progressive_merge_num` are described as follows:

* The default value is `0`, which indicates that 100 progressive compactions are performed.
* If the value is set to `1`, a full compaction is forcibly performed.
* If the value is set to an integer X, the full data is rewritten in X rounds, and 1/X of the full data is rewritten in each round.
