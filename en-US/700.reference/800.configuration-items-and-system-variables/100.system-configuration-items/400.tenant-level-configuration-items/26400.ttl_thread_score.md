## Description

`ttl_thread_score` specifies the weight of time slices of threads used by TTL-based deletion tasks. 

## Attributes

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Type | Integer |
| Default value | 0, which indicates that the default thread quantity is used. The default quantity is two threads. |
| Value range | [0, 100] |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

## Considerations

You can adjust the weight of directed acyclic graph (DAG) threads for TTL-based deletion tasks to modify the proportion of time slices of threads used by the tasks. 
If TTL-based deletion tasks run slowly, you can increase the value of `ttl_thread_score`. We recommend that you double the value each time. 

## Example

```sql
alter system set ttl_thread_score = 4 tenant = all_user;
```
