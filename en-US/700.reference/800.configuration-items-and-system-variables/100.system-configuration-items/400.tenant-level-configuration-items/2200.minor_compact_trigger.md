# minor_compact_trigger


`minor_compact_trigger` specifies the threshold for triggering the next-level compaction in hierarchical minor compactions. When the total number of mini SSTables in the current level reaches this threshold, all SSTables are compacted to the next level to form a new minor SSTable.

When `minor_compact_trigger` is set to 0, OceanBase Database still performs hierarchical minor compactions, which means that MemTable files are still dumped into Mini SSTable files. However, the Mini SSTable files are immediately compacted into a new Minor SSTable file to replace the original Minor SSTable file.
