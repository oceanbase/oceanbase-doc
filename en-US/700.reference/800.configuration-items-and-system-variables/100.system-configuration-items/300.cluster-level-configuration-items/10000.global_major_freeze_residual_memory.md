========================================================

`global_major_freeze_residual_memory` specifies the remaining memory for triggering a global freeze. When the available memory is less than this threshold, a global freeze is triggered.

| Default value | 40 |
| Value range | \[1, 99\] |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |


The value of `global_major_freeze_residual_memory` is in percentage with `memory_limit` - `system_memory` as the base. To be specific, the base is the total memory minus the memory reserved for internal system tenant 500. After the data of a frozen MemStore is merged, the occupied memory can be released. Therefore, the memory occupied by the frozen MemStore is considered as memory available for active_memstore, and the memory that the block cache can occupy is also considered as memory available to the MemStore.

  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>   The value of <code>global_major_freeze_residual_memory</code> must be greater than that of <code>global_write_halt_residual_memory</code>. Otherwise, the global freeze trigger will not take effect, and a global freeze can be triggered only by tenants.   </p>
