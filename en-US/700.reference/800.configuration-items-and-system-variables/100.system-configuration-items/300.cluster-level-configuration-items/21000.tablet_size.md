tablet_size
================================

`tablet_size` specifies the size of each shard during intra-partition parallel processing such as parallel compaction and query. You must specify the unit. By default, MB is used.


| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|----------|
| Type | Capacity |
| Default value | 128M |
| Value range | \[0, +∞) |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |



The value must be a multiple of 2M. If you set `tablet_size` to 0, intra-partition parallel processing is disabled.
