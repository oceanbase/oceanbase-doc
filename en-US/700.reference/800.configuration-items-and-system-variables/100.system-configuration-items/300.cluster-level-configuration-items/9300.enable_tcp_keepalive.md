The keepalive mechanism for client connections checks whether the client is running. If the client quits unexpectedly, the system can release the corresponding server-side resources. In addition, some network devices, such as load balancer or gateway, will check the status of connections that go through them. Connections that stay `idle` for a long time will be terminated or released by the device, resulting in unexpected disconnection between the client and the server. The keepalive mechanism can prevent this issue.
