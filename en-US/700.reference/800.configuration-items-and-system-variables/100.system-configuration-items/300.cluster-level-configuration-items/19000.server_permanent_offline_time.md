# server_permanent_offline_time

`server_permanent_offline_time` specifies the time threshold for heartbeat missing at which a server is considered permanently offline. Data replicas on a permanently offline server must be automatically supplemented.

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|------------|
| Type | Time |
| Default value | 3600s |
| Value range | \[20s, +∞) |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

After this parameter is configured, the system starts replicating data replicas on a permanently offline server only after the replicas have been missing for the specified time. This can avoid unnecessary replica replication.

The following section describes the application scenarios of this parameter and its recommended values:

* OceanBase Database version upgrade: We recommend that you set the value of this parameter to `72h`.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When you upgrade OceanBase Database V2.1.2 or later by using OCP V2.3.5 or later, the system automatically sets this parameter to <code>72h</code>. </p>
  </main>

* OBServer node hardware replacement: We recommend that you set the value of this parameter to `4h`.

* OBServer node rollout with the data directory cleared: We recommend that you set the value of this parameter to `10m` to achieve fast cluster rollout.
