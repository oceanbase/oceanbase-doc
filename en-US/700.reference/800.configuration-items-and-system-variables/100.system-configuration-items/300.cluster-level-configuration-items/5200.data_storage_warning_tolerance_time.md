When an unexpected I/O failure occurs, the I/O manager of OceanBase Database starts a detection thread to detect the data disk status. If the data disk status fails to become normal within the period specified by this parameter, the detection thread sets the data disk status to `WARNING`. This state triggers events such as a leader switchover to respond to business requests.

**Example**

```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET data_storage_warning_tolerance_time = 20s;
```
