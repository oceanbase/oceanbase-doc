# dead_socket_detection_timeout


`dead_socket_detection_timeout` specifies the time interval for detecting invalid sockets.


<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The default value has been changed from `10s` to `3s` since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|------------|
| Type | Time |
| Default value | 3s |
| Value range | \[0s, 2h] |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

Take note of the following considerations:

* If `dead_socket_detection_timeout` is set to `0`, socket-level fault detection is disabled.



* If `dead_socket_detection_timeout` is set to a value greater than `0`, socket-level fault detection is enabled. When a data sender does not receive a response from the receiver within the specified period, the current socket is deemed unavailable.
