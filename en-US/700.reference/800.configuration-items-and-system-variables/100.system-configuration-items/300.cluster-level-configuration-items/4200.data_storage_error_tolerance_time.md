# data_storage_error_tolerance_time

`data_storage_error_tolerance_time` specifies the tolerance period after which the status of an abnormal data disk is set to `ERROR`.

| Attribute | Description |
|------------------|----------------|
| Type | Time |
| Default value | 300s |
| Value range | \[10s, 7200s\] |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |

When an unexpected I/O failure occurs, the I/O manager of OceanBase Database starts a detection thread to detect the data disk status. If the data disk status fails to become normal within the period specified by this parameter, the detection thread sets the data disk status to `ERROR`. This state triggers events such as shutdown to avoid failures of the requests that are sent to the server.

**Example**


```sql
obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET data_storage_error_tolerance_time = 1800s;
```
