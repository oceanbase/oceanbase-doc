# enable_sys_unit_standalone

`enable_sys_unit_standalone` specifies whether the system unit of the system tenant is a standalone node.


| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Type | Boolean |
| Default value | False |
| Value range | <li> True   <li> False |
| Effective upon OBServer node restart | No |



When you set this parameter to `True`, note that:

* When you create or add resource pools, you cannot deploy units of a user tenant and units of the system tenant on the same server.



* The system will migrate the units of other tenants from the server on which the units of the system tenant are deployed.



* When a server is permanently offline or deleted, the system will migrate units of the system tenant first to one server and then migrate the units of other tenants to a different server.



* During balancing for tenant groups, the system filters out the server where the units of the system tenant are deployed from servers that are available to tenant groups. That is, units of tenants in the tenant groups will be distributed among all servers, except the server where the units of the system tenant are located.
