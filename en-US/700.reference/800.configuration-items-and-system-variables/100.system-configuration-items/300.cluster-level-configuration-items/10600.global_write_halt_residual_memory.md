# global_write_halt_residual_memory

`global_write_halt_residual_memory` specifies the global available memory threshold that triggers the suspension of write operations of user tenants. The sys tenant is not affected. That is, when the global available memory is smaller than the configured percentage, user tenants are no longer allowed to write data to the memory, while write operations of the sys tenant are not affected.

The value of `global_write_halt_residual_memory` is in percentage with `memory_limit` - `system_memory` as the base. To be specific, the base is the total memory minus the memory reserved for the SYS500 tenant. During the calculation of the available memory, the memory that the block cache can occupy is considered as memory available to the MemStore.
