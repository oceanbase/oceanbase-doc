  <h4>Note</h4>

For example, if this parameter is set to 5d, all the historical metadata generated in the last five days is retained, and only earlier historical metadata can be recycled by the historical metadata recycling service. For more information about the historical metadata recycling service, see [schema_history_recycle_interval](../300.cluster-level-configuration-items/18100.schema_history_recycle_interval.md).
