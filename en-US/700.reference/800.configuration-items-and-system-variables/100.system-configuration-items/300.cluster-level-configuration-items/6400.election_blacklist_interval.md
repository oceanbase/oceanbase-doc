  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <p>  The leader replica is added to the blocklist only when it stops acting as the leader and the observer process is not restarted. After the observer process restarts, the leader replica is not in the blocklist anymore.    </p>
</main>

OceanBase Database uses the `election_blacklist_interval` parameter to implement a blocklist feature. If a leader replica stops acting as the leader, from the moment when it becomes a follower, it would not be re-elected as the leader again within the time period specified by `election_blacklist_interval`. That is, that replica is added to the election blocklist.
