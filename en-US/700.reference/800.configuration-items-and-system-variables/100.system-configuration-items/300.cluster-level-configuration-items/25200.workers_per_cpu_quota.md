The number of threads that can be processed simultaneously in a tenant is controlled by two parameters: `cpu_quota_concurrency` and `workers_per_cpu_quota`. In addition, the value of `workers_per_cpu_quota` must be greater than that of `cpu_quota_concurrency`.

The parameters are described as follows:

* `workers_per_cpu_quota` specifies the maximum number of worker threads that a tenant can allocate to each CPU.

* `cpu_quota_concurrency` specifies the number of active worker threads on each CPU of the tenant. For more information about `cpu_quota_concurrency`, see [cpu_quota_concurrency](../400.tenant-level-configuration-items/1800.cpu_quota_concurrency.md).
