enable_upgrade_mode
========================================

`enable_upgrade_mode` specifies whether to enable the upgrade mode. In upgrade mode, some backend system features are suspended.

| Type | Boolean |
| Default value | False |
| Value range | <li> True   <li> False |

Before an upgrade, you can use this parameter to control the features (such as DDL operations) that need to be prohibited to simplify the upgrade process. Set `enable_upgrade_mode` to `True` before the upgrade and then set it to `False` after the upgrade.
