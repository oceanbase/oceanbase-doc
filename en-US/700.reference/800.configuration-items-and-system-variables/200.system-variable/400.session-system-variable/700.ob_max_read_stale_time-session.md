# ob_max_read_stale_time

`ob_max_read_stale_time` specifies the maximum latency threshold in microseconds for weak-consistency read queries.
The weak-consistency read latency threshold is controlled at the session level. For weak-consistency read requests of the current session, the data read must be within the specified latency threshold. You can set different latency thresholds for different sessions.
