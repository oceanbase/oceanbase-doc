The TRACING and STAT hints can instruct the executor to print each line of content during operator execution. To make the content easy to search and identify, you can use tracefile_identifier to specify a string, such as `XXXYYYZZZ` or `MY_TRACE`. The string is output with the row content to the log for ease of searching.
