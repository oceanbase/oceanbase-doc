# query_rewrite_integrity

<main id="notice" type='explain'>

  <h4>Note</h4>

  <p>This variable was introduced in OceanBase Database V4.3.1. </p>

</main>

## Description

`query_rewrite_integrity` specifies the level of data consistency checks for query rewriting with materialized views. 

## Limitations

* Query the variable

   * Global-level operation

      In the `sys` tenant or a user tenant, you can execute the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement to query the variable at the global level or query the `SYS.TENANT_VIRTUAL_GLOBAL_VARIABLE` (in Oracle mode) or `information_schema.GLOBAL_VARIABLES` (in MySQL mode) view for the variable at the global level. 

   * Session-level operation

      In the `sys` tenant or a user tenant, you can execute the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement to query the variable at the session level or query the `SYS.TENANT_VIRTUAL_SESSION_VARIABLE` (in Oracle mode) or `information_schema.SESSION_VARIABLES` (in MySQL mode) view for the variable at the session level. 

* Modify the variable

   * Global-level operation

      * In the `sys` tenant, you can directly change the value of the variable at the global level. 

      * In a MySQL user tenant, you must have the `SUPER` or `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege to change the value of the variable at the global level. 

      * In OceanBase Database V4.2.0 and later V4.x versions, you must have the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege to change the value of the variable at the global level in an Oracle user tenant. 

   * Session-level operation

      In the `sys` tenant or a user tenant, you can directly change the value of the variable at the session level for the current tenant. 

## Attributes

| **Attribute** | **Description** |
|----------|--------------|
| Type | ENUM |
| Default value | `enforced` |
| Value range | `enforced` and `stale_tolerated`  <ul><li> `enforced`: specifies to use only real-time materialized views for query rewriting. In this case, the system calculates the current real-time data based on the data of the materialized view to ensure consistency between the result of the rewritten query and that of the original query. </li><li>`stale_tolerated`: specifies to allow the use of non-real-time materialized views for query rewriting. This can cause inconsistency between the result of the rewritten query and that of the original query. In this case, even if a real-time materialized view that supports online calculation is used in query rewriting, the system does not calculate the current real-time data online. </li></ul> |
| Effective scope | <ul><li>Global</li><li>Session</li></ul> |
| Modifiable | Yes. You can use the `SET` statement to modify the variable.  |

## Considerations

This variable takes effect only when the [query_rewrite_enabled](11050.query_rewrite_enabled-global.md) variable is set to a value other than `false`. 

## Examples

Specify to use only real-time materialized views for query rewriting. 

* Set the variable at the session level

   ```shell
   obclient> SET  query_rewrite_integrity= enforced;
   ```

* Set the variable at the global level

   ```shell
   obclient> SET GLOBAL  query_rewrite_integrity= enforced;
   ```
