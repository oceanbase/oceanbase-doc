## Attributes

## Considerations

The workspace memory is used by blocking operators such as SQL Sort, and is specified by the system variable `ob_sql_work_area_percentage`, with a default value of 5%. The maximum memory for a workspace is calculated by using the following formula: Tenant memory Ã— `ob_sql_work_area_percentage`.

The error of insufficient workspace memory is often reported when a great number of concurrent requests are involved and each request occupies a large amount of workspace memory, for example, when the `Union`, `Sort`, or `Group By` operator is used. To resolve this issue, you can increase the value of the `ob_sql_work_area_percentage` variable. Here is an example:

```shell
obclient> SET GLOBAL ob_sql_work_area_percentage = 10;
```
