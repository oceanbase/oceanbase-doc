# INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROUTINES

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROUTINES` dictionary view provides information about stored routines such as stored procedures and storage functions, which do not include built-in (local) functions or loadable functions.
The following table describes the fields in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA ROUTINES` dictionary view.


| **Field** | **Description** |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| SPECIFIC_NAME | The name of the stored routine.  |
| ROUTINE_CATALOG | The name of the catalog to which the stored routine belongs. The value of this field is always `def`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| ROUTINE_SCHEMA | The name of the schema (or database) to which the stored routine belongs.  |
| ROUTINE_NAME | The name of the stored routine, which is the same as the `SPECIFIC_NAME`.  |
| ROUTINE_TYPE | The type of the stored routine. For a stored procedure, the value is `PROCEDURE`. For a storage function, the value is `FUNCTION`.  |
| DATA_TYPE | The data type of the return value of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, this field is empty. The value of `DATA_TYPE` contains only the type name, without other information. The value of `DTD_IDENTIFIER` contains the data type name and other information, such as the precision or length. At present, this field is not used.  |
| CHARACTER_MAXIMUM_LENGTH | The maximum character length for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| CHARACTER_OCTET_LENGTH | The maximum length for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function, in bytes. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| NUMERIC_PRECISION | The numeric precision of the return value of the stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| NUMERIC_SCALE | The numeric scale of the return value of the stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| DATETIME_PRECISION | The fractional seconds precision of the temporal return value of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`.  At present, this field is not used.  |
| CHARACTER_SET_NAME | The character set name for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`. At present, this field is not used. |
| COLLATION_NAME | The collation name for string return values of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, the value of this field is `NULL`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| DTD_IDENTIFIER | The data type of the return value of the routine if the routine is a stored function. If the routine is a stored procedure, this field is empty.  The value of `DATA_TYPE` contains only the type name, without other information. The value of `DTD_IDENTIFIER` contains the data type name and other information, such as the precision or length.  |
| ROUTINE_BODY | The language used for the routine definition. The value of this field is always SQL.  |
| ROUTINE_DEFINITION | The text of the SQL statement executed by the routine.  |
| EXTERNAL_NAME | The value of this field is always `NULL`.  |
| EXTERNAL_LANGUAGE | The language of the stored routine. At present, this field is not used.  |
| PARAMETER_STYLE | The value of this field is always SQL.  |
| IS_DETERMINISTIC | Indicates whether the stored routine is defined with the `DETERMINISTIC` characteristic. Valid value: `YES` or `NO`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| SQL_DATA_ACCESS | The data access characteristic for the stored routine. The value can be `CONTAINS SQL`, `NO SQL`, `READS SQL DATA`, or `MODIFIES SQL DATA`.  |
| SQL_PATH | The value of this field is always `NULL`.  |
| SECURITY_TYPE | The `SQL SECURITY` characteristic of the routine. The value can be `DEFINER` or `INVOKER`. At present, this field is not used.  |
| CREATED | The date and time when the routine was created. The value type is `TIMESTAMP`.  |
| LAST_ALTERED | The date and time when the routine was last modified.  If the routine has not been modified since its creation, the value of this field is the same as the value of `CREATED`.  |
| SQL_MODE | The SQL mode in effect when the routine was created or modified and under which the routine executes.  |
| ROUTINE_COMMENT | The comment text of the routine, if any. The value can be empty.  |
| DEFINER | The account named in the `DEFINER` clause, in the format of `'user_name'@'host_name'`. It is often the user who created the routine.  |
| CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT | The value of the `CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT` system variable in the current session when the stored routine was created or modified.  |
| COLLATION_CONNECTION | The value of the `COLLATION_CONNECTION` system variable in the current session when the stored routine was created or modified.  |
| DATABASE_COLLATION | The value of the `DATABASE_COLLATION` system variable in the current session when the stored routine was created or modified.  |
