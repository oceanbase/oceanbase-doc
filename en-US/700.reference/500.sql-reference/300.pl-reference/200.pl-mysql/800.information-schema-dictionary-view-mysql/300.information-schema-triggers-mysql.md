# INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS

The `INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS` dictionary view provides information about triggers. To view information about triggers of a table, you must have the `TRIGGER` privilege on the table.

The following table describes the columns in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA TRIGGERS` dictionary view.


| Column | Description |
|------------------------|------------------|
| TRIGGER_CATALOG | The name of the catalog to which the trigger belongs. The value of this column is always `def`.  |
| TRIGGER_SCHEMA | The name of the schema (or database) to which the trigger belongs.  |
| TRIGGER_NAME | The name of the trigger.  |
| EVENT_MANIPULATION | The trigger event. It is the type of operation on the table that the trigger is associated with. The value can be `INSERT` (a row is inserted), `DELETE` (a row is deleted), or `UPDATE` (a row is modified).  |
| EVENT_OBJECT_CATALOG, EVENT_OBJECT_SCHEMA, and EVENT_OBJECT_TABLE | Each trigger is associated with only one table. These columns indicate the directory and schema (database) to which this table belongs and the table name, respectively. The value of `EVENT_OBJECT_CATALOG` is always `def`.  |
| ACTION_ORDER | The order and location of trigger operations in the list of triggers with the same `EVENT_MANIPULATION` and `ACTION_TIMING` values on the same table.  |
| ACTION_CONDITION | The value of this column is always `NULL`.  |
| ACTION_STATEMENT | The statement executed when the trigger fires. The text is UTF-8 encoded.  |
| ACTION_ORIENTATION | The value of this field is always `ROW`.  |
| ACTION_TIMING | Indicates whether a trigger fires before or after a trigger event. Valid values: `BEFORE` and `AFTER`.  |
| ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_TABLE | The value of this column is always `NULL`.  |
| ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_TABLE | The value of this column is always `NULL`.  |
| ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_ROW, ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_ROW | The old column identifier and the new column identifier. The value of `ACTION_REFERENCE_OLD_ROW` is always `OLD`. The value of `ACTION_REFERENCE_NEW_ROW` is always `NEW`.  |
| CREATED | The date and time when the trigger was created. The type of the value is `TIMESTAMP(2)` (with the fractional part in hundredth seconds).  |
| SQL_MODE | The SQL mode in effect when the trigger was created.  |
| DEFINER | The account named in the `DEFINER` clause, in the format of `'user_name'@'host_name'`. It is often the user who created the trigger.  |
| CHARACTER_SET_CLIENT | The value of the `character_set_client` system variable in the current session when the trigger was created.  |
| COLLATION_CONNECTION | The value of the `collation_connection` system variable in the current session when the trigger was created.  |
| DATABASE_COLLATION | The collation of the database associated with the trigger.  |


Here is an example:

       WHERE TRIGGER_SCHEMA='test' AND TRIGGER_NAME='test_trg'\G

          ACTION_STATEMENT: TRIGGER test_trg BEFORE UPDATE ON test
                            FOR EACH ROW
                            BEGIN
                            IF NEW.user_num < 1 THEN
