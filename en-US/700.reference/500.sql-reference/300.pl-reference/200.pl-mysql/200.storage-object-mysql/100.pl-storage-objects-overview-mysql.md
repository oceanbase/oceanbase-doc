# Overview

In the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, PL stored programs include stored procedures, stored functions, and triggers.

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database supports PL stored objects of the following types:

* Stored procedure: A stored procedure is created by using the `CREATE PROCEDURE` statement and called by using the `CALL` statement. A stored procedure has no return value. However, it can have output parameters and generate a result set to return to the client program.

* Stored function: A stored function is created by using the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement and is used in a similar way to a built-in function. You can call a stored function in an expression to return a value during expression evaluation.

* Trigger: A trigger is generated by using the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement and is associated with a table. Operations such as insert or update on a table can fire triggers.

Stored procedures and functions are stored routines, and stored routines and triggers are stored programs.

Each stored program has a body that consists of multiple SQL statements separated with semicolons (;). The body of a stored procedure begins with the `BEGIN` keyword and ends with the `END;` keyword.
