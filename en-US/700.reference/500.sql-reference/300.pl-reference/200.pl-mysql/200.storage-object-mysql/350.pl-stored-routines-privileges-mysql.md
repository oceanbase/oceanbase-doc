# Stored objects and privilege management

In OceanBase Database, procedural language (PL) privileges are used to manage user operations on stored objects, including stored procedures and stored functions. Stored objects are a type of routines in a database. You can use the `CREATE PROCEDURE` or `CREATE FUNCTION` statement to create a stored procedure or stored function and specify the database to which the stored procedure or stored function belongs when you create it. A stored object is executed by using the `CALL` statement. A stored function is directly referenced in an expression and returns a value when it calculates the expression.

## Creation and privileges

The following table describes the privileges on stored objects in OceanBase Database.

| Privilege | Description |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| CREATE ROUTINE | The privilege to create stored procedures and stored functions. |
| EXECUTE | The privilege to execute stored procedures and stored functions. |
| ALTER ROUTINE | The privilege to modify and drop stored procedures and stored functions. |

- To create a stored object, you must have the `CREATE ROUTINE` privilege. A user granted the `CREATE ROUTINE` privilege can create stored procedures and stored functions.

- After a stored procedure is created, the system automatically grants the `EXECUTE` and `ALTER ROUTINE` privileges on the stored procedure to the user who created it.

Here is an example:

```shell
mysql> GRANT CREATE ROUTINE ON my.* TO mingye;
mysql> CREATE PROCEDURE p1()
    -> BEGIN
    -> SELECT 1 FROM dual;
    -> END;
    -> /
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for mingye@%                                                 |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO `mingye`@`%`                                  |
| GRANT CREATE ROUTINE ON `my`.* TO `mingye`@`%`                      |
| GRANT EXECUTE, ALTER ROUTINE ON PROCEDURE `my`.`p1` TO `mingye`@`%` |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

## `automatic_sp_privileges` system variable

If the default value of the `automatic_sp_privileges` system variable is set to `1`, the system automatically grants the `EXECUTE` and `ALTER ROUTINE` privileges. If you do not need either privilege, you can manually delete it.

Here is an example:

```shell
mysql> SELECT @@automatic_sp_privileges;
+---------------------------+
| @@automatic_sp_privileges |
+---------------------------+
|                         1 |
+---------------------------+
1 row in set (0.03 sec)
```

The value of `automatic_sp_privileges` is `1`. In this case, you can manually delete the privileges that are automatically granted to you.

```shell
mysql> REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE my.p1 FROM mingye;
mysql> CALL p1();/
```

Note that `automatic_sp_privileges` is a global variable. You must have the SUPER privilege to modify it. Here is an example:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL automatic_sp_privileges = 0;
ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the SUPER privilege(s) for this operation
```

## DEFINER and SECURITY TYPE

You can specify `DEFINER` when you create a stored procedure. If `DEFINER` is not specified during the creation of a stored procedure, it is automatically set to the user who created the stored procedure.

```shell
mysql> CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost' PROCEDURE p1()
       BEGIN
        UPDATE t1 SET counter = counter + 1;
       END;

mysql> SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS LIKE '%p2%';
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| Db   | Name | Type      | Definer         |x| Security_type |
+------+------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| test | p2   | PROCEDURE | admin@localhost |x| DEFINER       |
+------+------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
```

Specify a value for `DEFINER`.

- A user with the `SUPER` privilege can specify any value for `DEFINER`.
- Otherwise, the value of `DEFINER` can only be the current user. You can use `CURRENT_USER` or `CURRENT_USER()` to specify a value for `DEFINER`, or directly enter a value.

If you specify a nonexistent user for `DEFINER`, an orphan object is created.

The privileges required for calling a stored object are as follows:

- The caller must have the `EXECUTE` privilege.
- The definer must have the `EXECUTE` privilege.

A stored object is executed based on the privileges of its definer, which is specified by `DEFINER`.

### Convert a stored object into an orphan object

When you attempt to drop a user that has been defined as the definer of any stored object, the operation will fail. In this case, you must first drop or modify the stored object, and then drop the user.
- When you execute the `DROP USER` statement to drop a user that is the definer of a stored object, the execution fails and an error is returned.
- When you execute the `RENAME USER` statement to rename a user that is the definer of a stored object, the execution fails and an error is returned.

If the system allows you to drop a user that is the definer of a stored object without dropping or modifying the stored object first, the stored object becomes an orphan object after the user is dropped.

### Enable an orphan object to be adopted by a user

If an orphan object, namely an object without a valid definer, exists, the orphan object remains in the original state after you create a user with the same name as the original definer of the orphan object. You need to explicitly make the user adopt the orphan object.

When you execute the `CREATE USER` statement to create a user that is the definer of a stored object, the execution fails and an error is returned.

## SECURITY TYPE

You can specify `SQL SECURITY` when you create a stored object. If this parameter is not explicitly specified, the default value is `DEFINER`. The valid values are `DEFINER` and `INVOKER`.

```sql
mysql> CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost' PROCEDURE p2()
     SQL SECURITY INVOKER
     BEGIN
       UPDATE t1 SET counter = counter + 1;
     END;
     /
mysql> SHOW PROCEDURE STATUS LIKE '%p2%';
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+------+------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| Db   | Name | Type      | Definer         |x| Security_type |
+------+------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
| test | p2   | PROCEDURE | admin@localhost |x| INVOKER       |
+------+------+-----------+-----------------+---------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+----------------------+----------------------+--------------------+
```

If `INVOKER` is specified for `SECURITY TYPE`, the stored object is executed based on the privileges of the caller. In this case, `DEFINER` is invalid.

The `SQL SECURITY` parameter is invalid for triggers and events, which are always executed in the definer context.

## Examples

The following example shows how to create a stored procedure. Create a stored procedure named `GetHighSalaryEmployees` that accepts an input parameter `minSalary` and returns information about employees whose salary exceeds the specified value.

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT);

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 50000),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 60000),
(3, 'Bob Johnson', 45000);

DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetHighSalaryEmployees(IN minSalary INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT name, salary
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > minSalary;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

Call the stored procedure.

```sql
obclient > CALL GetHighSalaryEmployees(55000);
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+------------+--------+
| name       | salary |
+------------+--------+
| Jane Smith |  60000 |
+------------+--------+
1 row in set
```

The preceding call will return the information about employees whose salary exceeds 55,000.

In the preceding example, the stored procedure is created by using the `CREATE ROUTINE` privilege. To grant other users the privilege to execute this stored procedure, execute the following statement:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE GetHighSalaryEmployees TO 'your_user'@'your_host';
```
