# CREATE TRIGGER

You can use the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement to create or replace a database trigger.

When specified conditions are met, the database automatically runs the trigger.

## Prerequisites

To create a trigger in your own schema or in a table of your own schema, you must have the `CREATE TRIGGER` system privilege.

To create a trigger in the schema (`schema.SCHEMA`) of other users, you must have the `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` system privilege.

If a trigger is used to execute an SQL statement or call a stored procedure or function, the owner of the trigger must have the privileges required to perform these operations. These privileges must be granted to the owner directly rather than through roles.

## Syntax

The syntax of `create_trigger` is as follows:

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ]
TRIGGER plsql_trigger_source
```

Specifically:

* The syntax of `plsql_trigger_source` is as follows:

   ```sql
   [schema.] trigger_name
     { simple_dml_trigger
      | instead_of_dml_trigger
      | trigger_ordering_clause
    }
   ```



* The syntax of `simple_dml_trigger` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { BEFORE | AFTER } dml_event_clause [ referencing_clause ] [ FOR EACH ROW ]
   [ ENABLE | DISABLE ] [ WHEN ( condition ) ] trigger_body
   ```



* The syntax of `instead_of_dml_trigger` is as follows:

   ```sql
   INSTEAD OF { DELETE | INSERT | UPDATE } [ OR { DELETE | INSERT | UPDATE } ]...
   ON [ schema. ] view
   [ referencing_clause ] [ FOR EACH ROW ]
   [ ENABLE | DISABLE ] trigger_body
   ```

* The syntax of `trigger_ordering_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { FOLLOWS | PRECEDES } [ schmema.] trigger_name [ , [ schmema.] trigger_name ]...
   ```

* The syntax of `dml_event_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { DELETE | INSERT | UPDATE [ OF column [, column ]... ] }
   [ OR { DELETE | INSERT | UPDATE [ OF column [, column]... ] }...]
   ON [ schema.] { table | view }
   ```



* The syntax of `referencing_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   REFERENCING
   { OLD [ AS ] old
   | NEW [ AS ] new
   | PARENT [ AS ] parent
   }..
   ```



* The syntax of `trigger_body` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { plsql_block | CALL routine_clause }
   ```






## Semantics



| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| create_trigger | OR REPLACE | Re-creates this trigger (if any) and recompiles it. Before the trigger is redefined, users granted the access privilege can still access this trigger without the need to obtain the access privilege again.  |
| create_trigger | trigger_name | The name of the trigger to be created.  |
| plsql_trigger_source | schema | The name of the schema where the trigger is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| plsql_trigger_source | simple_dml_trigger | Creates a simple DML trigger.  |
| plsql_trigger_source | instead_of_dml_trigger | Creates an `INSTEAD OF` DML trigger. An `INSTEAD OF` trigger can read the `:OLD` and `:NEW` values, but cannot modify these values.  |
| plsql_trigger_source | trigger_ordering_clause | The firing sequence of triggers with the same point in time. The specified triggers must exist and be correctly compiled. However, you do not need to enable the specified triggers.  |
| simple_dml_trigger | BEFORE | Enables the database to fire the trigger before a trigger event occurs. A row-level trigger will fire before the corresponding row is modified. In a statement-level `BEFORE` trigger, the trigger body cannot read the `:NEW` or `:OLD` field. However, in a row-level `BEFORE` trigger, the trigger body can read and write the `:OLD` and `:NEW` fields. |
| simple_dml_trigger | AFTER | Enables the database to fire the trigger after a trigger event occurs. A row-level trigger will fire each time a row is modified. In a statement-level `AFTER` trigger, the trigger body cannot read the `:NEW` or `:OLD` field. However, in a row-level `AFTER` trigger, the trigger body can read and write the `:OLD` and `:NEW` fields. |
| simple_dml_trigger | FOR EACH ROW | Creates the trigger as a row-level trigger. When the optional trigger constraint defined in the `WHEN` condition is met, the database fires the row-level trigger. If this clause is ignored, the trigger is a statement-level trigger. If the optional trigger constraint is met, the database fires the trigger as a statement-level trigger only when a trigger statement is executed.  |
| simple_dml_trigger | \[ ENABLE \| DISABLE \] | Creates a trigger that is in the enabled or disabled state. By default, a trigger in the enabled state is created. Creating a trigger that is in the disabled state ensures that the trigger can be correctly compiled before it is enabled.  |
| simple_dml_trigger | WHEN (condition) | An SQL condition. The database evaluates each row affected by the trigger statement. If the `condition` value of an affected row is `TRUE`, `trigger_body` runs in this row. Otherwise, `trigger_body` does not run in this row. The trigger statement will run regardless of the condition value. In the `condition` statement, do not place a semicolon (:) prior to `NEW`, `OLD`, or `PARENT`. If `WHEN (condition)` is specified, `FOR EACH ROW` must also be specified. `condition` must not contain subqueries or PL expressions, such as calls to user-defined functions.  |
| simple_dml_trigger | trigger_body | The PL block or `CALL` subprogram used by the database to fire the trigger. The `CALL` subprogram is encapsulated in PL. If `trigger_body` is a PL block that contains errors, the `CREATE [OR REPLACE]` statement will fail to be executed.  |
| simple_dml_trigger | dml_event_clause | The condition for triggering a DML event in the trigger. DML events include INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | view | The name of the view on which the trigger is to be created.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | FOR EACH ROW | Creates the `INSTEAD OF` trigger as a row-level trigger.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | \[ ENABLE \| DISABLE \] | Specifies whether to enable or disable the trigger. By default, the trigger is enabled. Creating a trigger in the disabled state can ensure that the trigger is enabled after it is correctly compiled.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | DELETE | Enables the database to fire the trigger created on a view each time the `DELETE` statement deletes a row from the defined table.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | INSERT | Enables the database to fire the trigger created on a view each time the `INSERT` statement inserts a row to the defined table.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | UPDATE | Enables the database to fire the trigger created on a view each time the `UPDATE` statement modifies the value of a column in the defined table.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | schema | The name of the schema where the trigger is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| instead_of_dml_trigger | trigger_body | The PL block or `CALL` subprogram used by the database to fire the trigger. The `CALL` subprogram is encapsulated in PL. If `trigger_body` is a PL block that contains errors, the `CREATE [OR REPLACE]` statement will fail to be executed.  |
| trigger_ordering_clause | No keyword specified | The firing sequence of triggers with the same point in time. The specified triggers must exist and be correctly compiled. However, you do not need to enable the specified triggers.  |
| trigger_ordering_clause | FOLLOWS | Indicates that the new trigger fires after the specified trigger.  |
| trigger_ordering_clause | PRECEDES | Indicates that the new trigger fires before the specified trigger.  |



## Examples

Example 1: Create a DML trigger named `del_new_region`.

```shell
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER del_new_region
      BEFORE DELETE ON regions
      FOR EACH ROW
      WHEN (old.region_id >3)
   BEGIN
      INSERT INTO reg_his(region_id , region_name )
           VALUES( :old.region_id, :old.region_name );
   END;
 /
```

Example 2: Create a trigger named `tri2_t`, which fires after another trigger named `tri1_t`.

```shell
CREATE SEQUENCE seq_tri INCREMENT BY 1 START WITH 1 NOMAXVALUE MINVALUE 0 NOCYCLE NOCACHE;
CREATE TABLE t(c1 INT, c2 INT);
CREATE TABLE msg (c1 INT PRIMARY KEY, c2 VARCHAR(100));
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tri1_t BEFORE INSERT ON t FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO msg VALUES (seq_tri.NEXTVAL, 'BEFORE INSERT tri1_t');
END;
/

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tri2_t BEFORE INSERT ON t FOR EACH ROW FOLLOWS tri1_t
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO msg VALUES (seq_tri.nextval, 'BEFORE INSERT tri2_t');
END;
/

INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 1);

obclient> SELECT * FROM msg;
+----+----------------------+
| C1 | C2                   |
+----+----------------------+
|  1 | BEFORE INSERT tri1_t |
|  2 | BEFORE INSERT tri2_t |
+----+----------------------+
2 rows in set
```
