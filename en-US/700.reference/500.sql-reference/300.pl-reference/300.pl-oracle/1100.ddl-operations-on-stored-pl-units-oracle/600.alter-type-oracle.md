You can use the `ALTER TYPE` statement to modify the existing attributes or scalar attributes of an object type.  You can also use this statement to recompile the specification or body of a type, or add new object member subprogram specifications to modify the specification of the object type.

You can use the `ALTER TYPE` statement to perform the following operations on a type created by using the `CREATE TYPE` or `CREATE TYPE BODY` statement:

* Evolve the type, which is to add or drop member attributes or methods.



* Add object member subprogram specifications to modify the specification of the type.



* Recompile the specification or body of the type.



* Reset the version of the type to 1, so that evolution is no longer considered for the type.






Prerequisites
-------------------------

If a type is in the schema of the `SYS` user, you must connect to the database with the `SYSDBA` role. Otherwise, the type must be in your own schema, or you must have the `CREATE TYPE` or `CREATE ANY TYPE` system privilege.

Syntax
-----------------------

The syntax of `alter_type` is as follows:

```sql
CREATE TYPE or CREATE ANY TYPE
```



The following shows more details:

* The syntax of `alter_type_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { type_compile_clause
   | type_replace_clause
   | RESET
   | [ NOT ] { INSTANTIABLE | FINAL }
   | { alter_method_spec
     | alter_attribute_definition
     | alter_collection_clauses
     } [ dependent_handling_clause ]
   } ;
   ```



* The syntax of `type_compile_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   COMPILE [ DEBUG ] [ SPECIFICATION | BODY ]
   [ compiler_parameters_clause ]... [ REUSE SETTINGS ]
   ```



* The syntax of `type_replace_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   REPLACE
   [ invoker_rights_clause [ accessible_by_clause ] |
     accessible_by_clause | invoker_rights_clause ] ]
   AS OBJECT  ( attribute datatype [, attribute datatype ]...
   [, element_spec [, element_spec ]... ] )
   ```



* The syntax of `element_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   [ inheritance_clauses ]
   { subprogram_spec
   | constructor_spec
   | map_order_function_spec
   }... [, restrict_references_pragma ]
   ```




* The syntax of `inheritance_clauses` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { [ NOT ] { OVERRIDING | FINAL | INSTANTIABLE } }...
   ```



* The syntax of `subprogram_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { MEMBER | STATIC } { procedure_spec | function_spec }
   ```



* The syntax of `procedure_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   PROCEDURE procedure_name
   ( parameter datatype [, parameter datatype ]... )  [ { IS | AS } call_spec ]
   ```



* The syntax of `function_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   PROCEDURE procedure_name
   ( parameter datatype [, parameter datatype ]... )  [ { IS | AS } call_spec ]
   ```



* The syntax of `constructor_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   [ FINAL ] [ INSTANTIABLE ] CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION datatype
   [ ([ SELF IN OUT datatype, ]
      parameter datatype [, parameter datatype ]...
     )
   ]
   RETURN SELF AS RESULT;
   [ { IS | AS } call_spec ]
   ```



* The syntax of `map_order_function_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { MAP | ORDER } MEMBER function_spec
   ```



* The syntax of `alter_method_spec` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { ADD | DROP } { map_order_function_spec | subprogram_spec }
   [, { ADD | DROP } { map_order_function_spec | subprogram_spec } ]...
   ```


* The syntax of `alter_attribute_definition` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { { ADD | MODIFY } ATTRIBUTE
        { attribute [ datatype ]
        | ( attribute datatype [, attribute datatype ]... )
        }
   | DROP ATTRIBUTE
        { attribute
        | ( attribute [, attribute ]... )
        }
   }
   ```



* The syntax of `alter_collections_clauses` is as follows:

   ```sql
   MODIFY { LIMIT integer | ELEMENT TYPE datatype }
   ```



* The syntax of `dependent_handling_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   { INVALIDATE
   | CASCADE [ { [ NOT ] INCLUDING TABLE DATA
               | CONVERT TO SUBSTITUTABLE
               }
             ]
        [ [FORCE ] exceptions_clause ]
   }
   ```



* The syntax of `exceptions_clause` is as follows:

   ```sql
   EXCEPTIONS INTO [ schema. ] table
   ```
