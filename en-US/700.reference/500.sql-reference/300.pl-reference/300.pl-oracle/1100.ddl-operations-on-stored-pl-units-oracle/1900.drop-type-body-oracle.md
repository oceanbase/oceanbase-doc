DROP TYPE BODY
===================================

You can use the `DROP TYPE BODY` statement to drop the body of an abstract data type (ADT), `VARRAY` type, or nested table type.

After the body of a type is dropped, the specification of the type still exists, and the body of the type can be re-created. Before the body of the type is re-created, this type can still be used, but its member functions cannot be called.

Prerequisites
-------------------------

The type body must be located in your own schema, or you must have the `ALTER ANY TYPE` system privilege.

Syntax
-----------------------

The syntax of `drop_type_body` is as follows:

```sql
DROP TYPE BODY [ schema. ] type_name ;
```



Semantics
-----------------------



| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|----------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| drop_type_body | schema | The name of the schema where the type is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| drop_type_body | type_name | The type body to be dropped.  Only a type body without type or table dependencies can be dropped.  |



Examples
-----------------------

Drop the type body named `demo_typ2`.

```sql
DROP TYPE BODY demo_typ2;
```
