DROP TYPE
==============================

You can use the `DROP TYPE` statement to drop the specification and body of an abstract data type (ADT), `VARRAY`, or nested table type.

Prerequisites
-------------------------

This ADT, `VARRAY`, or nested table type must be located in your own schema, or you must have the `ALTER ANY TYPE` system privilege.

Syntax
-----------------------

The syntax of `drop_type` is as follows:

```sql
DROP TYPE [ schema. ] type_name [ FORCE | VALIDATE ] ;
```



Semantics
-----------------------



| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| drop_type | schema | The name of the schema where the type is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| drop_type | type_name | The name of the ADT, `VARRAY`, or nested table type to be dropped. You can drop only a type on which no type or table depends.  If `type_name` specifies a supertype, the execution of this statement will fail.  If `type_name` specifies a statistical information type, the execution of this statement will fail.  If `type_name` specifies an ADT related to a statistical information type, the database will first attempt to disassociate `type_name` from the statistical information type, and then drop the object specified by `type_name`. However, if statistical information is collected by using the statistical information type, the database cannot disassociate `type_name` from the statistical information type, and the execution of this statement will fail.  If `type_name` specifies an index type, the database tags this index type as `INVALID`.  If a public synonym is defined on `type_name`, the database will also drop this synonym.  |



Examples
-----------------------

Drop the type named `demo_typ2`.

```sql
DROP TYPE demo_typ2 FORCE;
```
