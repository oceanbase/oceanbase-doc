# DROP TYPE

You can use the `DROP TYPE` statement to drop the specification and body of a user-defined abstract data type (ADT), variable array (`VARRAY`) type, or nested table type.

    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

## Prerequisites

This ADT, `VARRAY` type, or nested table type must be located in your own schema, or you must have the `ALTER ANY TYPE` system privilege.

## Syntax

The syntax of `drop_type` is as follows:

```sql
DROP TYPE [ schema. ] type_name [ FORCE | VALIDATE ] ;
```

## Semantics

| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------------------|
| drop_type | schema | The name of the schema where the type is located. The default value is your schema.  |
| drop_type | type_name | The name of the ADT, `VARRAY` type, or nested table type to be dropped. You can drop only a type on which no type or table depends. If `type_name` specifies a supertype, the execution of this statement will fail. If `type_name` specifies a statistical information type, the execution of this statement will fail. If `type_name` specifies an ADT associated with a statistical information type, the database will first attempt to disassociate the ADT specified by `type_name` from the statistical information type, and then drop the ADT. However, if statistical information is collected by using the statistical information type, the database cannot disassociate the ADT specified by `type_name` from the statistical information type, and the execution of this statement will fail. If `type_name` specifies an index type, the database tags this index type as `INVALID`. If a public synonym is defined on `type_name`, the database will also drop this synonym.  |

## Examples

Drop the type named `demo_typ2`.

```sql
DROP TYPE demo_typ2 FORCE;
```
