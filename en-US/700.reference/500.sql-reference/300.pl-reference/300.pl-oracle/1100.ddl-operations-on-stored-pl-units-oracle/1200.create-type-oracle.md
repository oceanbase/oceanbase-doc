# CREATE TYPE

You can use the `CREATE TYPE` statement to specify the name, method, and other attributes of a type.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

You can use the `CREATE TYPE` statement to create or replace the specifications of the following types:

* Abstract data type (ADT)

* Independent variable array (VARRAY) type

* Independent nested table type

* Incomplete object type

   An incomplete object type is a type created by using a forward type definition. An incomplete object type has a name but no attributes or methods. It can be referenced by other types and can be used to define types that reference each other.  However, you must first create a complete type before you use it to create table columns, object columns, or nested table columns.

The `CREATE TYPE BODY` statement is built in with the code for implementing the type.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If you create a type whose specification declares only attributes but no methods, you do not need to create the type body. </li>
    <li>You can use the <code>CREATE TYPE</code> statement to create nested tables and the VARRAY type, but not associative arrays. You can define three collection types in a PL block or package. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>


## Prerequisites

To create a type in your own schema, you must have the `CREATE TYPE` system privilege. To create a type in the schema of other users, you must have the `CREATE ANY TYPE` system privilege. You can obtain these privileges directly or through roles.

The owner of a type must be explicitly granted the `EXECUTE` object privilege or the `EXECUTE ANY TYPE` system privilege, to access all other types referenced in the definition of this type. The owner of a type cannot obtain these privileges through roles.

If the owner of a type wants to grant other users the access privilege on this type, the type owner must first be granted the `EXECUTE` object privilege by using `GRANT OPTION`, or the `EXECUTE ANY TYPE` system privilege by using `ADMIN OPTION`. Otherwise, the type owner does not have sufficient privileges to grant other users the access privilege on this type.

At present, you cannot use user-defined data types (UDTs) in the `CREATE TABLE` statement in OceanBase Database. This means that you can define object types in the database but you cannot directly use these data types for columns in a table when you create the table.

However, you can still use these data types in PL/SQL. In PL/SQL, you can use a UDT to define the return type of a variable, parameter, or function.

## Semantics


| Syntax | Keyword or syntax node | Description |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| create_type_stmt | OR REPLACE | Re-creates this type (if any) and recompiles it.  Before the type is redefined, users granted the access privilege can still access this type without the need to obtain the access privilege again. If any function-based index depends on this type, the database marks this index as DISABLED.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | pl_schema_name | The name of the schema containing the type.  The default value is your own schema.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | TYPE | The ADT name, nested table type, or VARRAY type.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | FORCE | If the type specified by `type_name` exists and depends on another type but does not depend on any table, the `FORCE` keyword will force this statement to replace the type. If the type specified by `type_name` depends on a table, the statement fails regardless of whether the `FORCE` keyword is used. <p><br>Note that if Type `t1` depends on Type `t2` and Type `t2` depends on a table, Type `t1` also depends on the table.</br></p>                 |
| plsql_type_spec_source | varray_type_def | Creates a type as an orderly set of elements of the same data type.  |
| plsql_type_spec_source | nested_table_type_def | Creates a nested table of the type specified by `datatype`.  |
| object_type_def | object_type_def | Creates an ADT. The variables that form the data structure are referred to as attributes. Member subprograms that define ADT behaviors are referred to as methods.  You need to use the `AS OBJECT` keyword when you create an ADT.  |
| object_type_def | AS OBJECT | Creates a schema-level ADT. A schema-level ADT is sometimes referred to as a root ADT.  |
| attr_and_element_spec | element_spec | Specifies each attribute of the ADT.  |
| subprogram_spec | subprogram_spec | Declares a subprocedure.  |
| subprogram_spec | member_or_static | <ul><li> `MEMBER`: Functions or stored procedures that are associated with an ADT are referred to as member functions. Generally, the body that calls the MEMBER method has an implicit first parameter, namely, SELF. This parameter indicates the object that calls this method.    </li><li> `STATIC`: The function or stored procedure associated with the ADT. Unlike the `MEMBER` method, the `STATIC` method does not have any implicit parameter. You cannot reference the `SELF` parameter in the body. The general call format is `type_name.method()`.  </li></ul> |
| subprogram_spec | proc_or_func_spec | Specifies the parameter and data type of the stored procedure or function. If this subprocedure does not contain the definition of the stored procedure or function, you must use the `CREATE TYPE BODY` statement to make the definition.  If you want to create a subtype, the name of the stored procedure or function cannot be the same as the name (regardless of whether it is inherited) of any attribute declared in the supertype link.  |

## Examples

### Create types

- Example 1: Create an object type

  Create an object type named `person_typ` that has two attributes `name` and `age` and a member function named `get_age` that is used to return the age of an object.

  ```sql
  CREATE TYPE person_typ AS OBJECT (
  name VARCHAR2(50),
  age NUMBER,
  MEMBER FUNCTION get_age RETURN NUMBER);
  ```

- Example 2: Create a VARRAY type

  Create a VARRAY type named `number_list`, which can store at most 10 numbers.

  ```sql
  CREATE TYPE number_list AS VARRAY(10) OF NUMBER;
  ```

### Complete usage example

The following example shows how to create and use an object type.

#### Step 1: Create an object type

Define the object type and its member function. Assume that the member function `get_age` is used to return only the age of an object.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE person_typ AS OBJECT (
  name VARCHAR2(50),
  age NUMBER,
  MEMBER FUNCTION get_age RETURN NUMBER
);
/
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE BODY person_typ AS
  MEMBER FUNCTION get_age RETURN NUMBER IS
  BEGIN
    RETURN self.age;
  END get_age;
END;
/
```

#### Step 2: Use the object type in PL/SQL

In PL/SQL, you can declare variables for `person_typ` to operate the data.

```sql
DECLARE
  v_person person_typ;
BEGIN
  v_person := person_typ('Charlie', 40);
  -- Return the age of Charlie
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Age: ' || v_person.get_age());

  -- Insert the information about Charlie into the people table
  INSERT INTO people (person_id, person_info) VALUES (2, v_person);
END;
/
```
