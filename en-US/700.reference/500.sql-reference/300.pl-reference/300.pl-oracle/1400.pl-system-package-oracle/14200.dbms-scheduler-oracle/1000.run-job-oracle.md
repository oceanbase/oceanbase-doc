# RUN_JOB

The `RUN_JOB` procedure immediately runs a job.

If a job is enabled, the Scheduler automatically runs the job. You do not need to call the `RUN_JOB` procedure to run the job based on its schedule. You call the `RUN_JOB` procedure to run only jobs that are not scheduled.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_SCHEDULER.RUN_JOB (
job_name              IN VARCHAR2,
force                 IN BOOLEAN );
```



## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------|------------------|
| job_name | The name of a job or a list of names that are separated by commas (,). Each name represents an existing job. You can add a schema name and dot separator before the name. If you specify a job that involves multiple destinations, the job runs on all destinations.  |
| force | Specify whether to force run the job. The value `TRUE` specifies to force run the job.  |


## Considerations

If a job is disabled, make sure that the following validity requirements are met before you run the job:

* The job points to a valid job class.

* The job owner has the `EXECUTE` privilege on the job.

* If a program is referenced, the program must exist.

* If a program is referenced, the job owner must have the privilege to execute the program.

* All parameter values are set or have default values.


## Examples

Immediately run the `MYJOB` and `SYS.HRJOB` jobs.

```sql
BEGIN
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.RUN_JOB(
    JOB_NAME            => 'MYJOB, SYS.HRJOB',
    force               => TURE);
END;
```
