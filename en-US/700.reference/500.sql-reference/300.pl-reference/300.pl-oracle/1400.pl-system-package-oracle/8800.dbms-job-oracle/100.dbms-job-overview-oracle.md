# Overview

The `DBMS_JOB` package schedules and manages jobs in the job queue.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The <code>DBMS_JOB</code> package is not recommended in OceanBase Database V4.x. We recommend that you use the <code>DBMS_SCHEDULER</code> package instead. </p>
  </main>

## Privileges

You do not need any special system privileges to use and manage the `DBMS_JOB` package. Only the owner of a job or a user granted the database administrator (DBA) privileges can modify or delete the job.

## Considerations

`DBMS_JOB` allows a job to run in multiple zones. By default, a job can run in any zone. However, only one zone can be specified for a job. You can specify the name of a zone to bind a job to the zone.

The following describes the procedure for creating, modifying, and running a job associated with a zone. If no associated zone is specified, the job can run in any zone.

1. Call `DBMS_JOB.SUBMIT` to submit the job to the job queue.


2. Call `DBMS_JOB.ZONE` to allocate a zone for running the job.


3. Call `DBMS_JOB.CHANGE` to modify the custom parameters related to the job.


4. Call `DBMS_JOB.RUN` to run the job.


5. Stop the job.
