# PURGE_LOG

The `PURGE_LOG` procedure purges materialized view logs to reduce the size of the log file. This operation will delete all materialized view logs related to the specified master table (base table).

If data in materialized view logs (mlogs) has not been merged into the materialized view, `PURGE_LOG` will not clear these unmerged mlog data. In the case of multiple downstream materialized views, `PURGE_LOG` will only clear the mlog data that has been processed by the last one of all materialized views, thereby ensuring the data integrity of all materialized views is not affected.
