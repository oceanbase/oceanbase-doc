## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CREATE_PURGE_JOB(
audit_trail_type            IN PLS_INTEGER,
audit_trail_purge_interval  IN PLS_INTEGER,
audit_trail_purge_name      IN VARCHAR2,
use_last_arch_timestamp     IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE) ;
```



## Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| audit_trail_type | The audit trail type of the purge job. For more information about audit trail types, see [Audit trail types](../2600.dbms-audit-mgmt-oracle/100.dbms-audit-mgmt-overview-oracle.md).  |
| audit_trail_purge_interval | The interval for calling the purge procedure, in hours. The smaller the value is, the more frequently audit trail records are purged.  |
| audit_trail_purge_name | The name of the purge job.  |
| use_last_arch_timestamp | Specifies whether to delete records based on the last archive timestamp.  Valid values: <ul><li> `TRUE`: Only audit records created before the last archive timestamp are deleted.    </li><li> `FALSE`: All audit records are deleted. </li></ul>    Default value: `TRUE`.  |



## Considerations

This procedure calls the `CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL` procedure to purge audit trail records based on the specified interval.

## Examples

The following example calls the `CREATE_PURGE_JOB` procedure to create a purge job named `MyCLEANUP` for OS audit trail records. The purge job is called every 72 hours to delete all audit records created earlier than the last archive timestamp.

```sql
BEGIN
   DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CREATE_PURGE_JOB(
     audit_trail_type             =>  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_OS,
     audit_trail_purge_interval   =>  72 /*hours*/,  
     audit_trail_purge_name       =>  'MyCLEANUP',
     use_last_arch_timestamp      =>  TRUE);
END;
```
