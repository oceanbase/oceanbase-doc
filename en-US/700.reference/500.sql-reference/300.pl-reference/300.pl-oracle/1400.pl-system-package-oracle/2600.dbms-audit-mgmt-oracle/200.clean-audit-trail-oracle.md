# CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL

The `CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL` procedure deletes audit trail records.

  <main id="notice" >
    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies only to OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
audit_trail_type         IN PLS_INTEGER,
use_last_arch_timestamp  IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE);
```



## Parameters


| Parameter | Description |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| audit_trail_type | The type of audit trail records to be deleted. For more information about audit trail types, see [Audit trail types](../2600.dbms-audit-mgmt-oracle/100.dbms-audit-mgmt-overview-oracle.md).  |
| use_last_arch_timestamp | Specifies whether to delete records based on the last archive timestamp. Valid values: <ul><li> `TRUE`: Only audit records created before the last archive timestamp are deleted.   </li><li> `FALSE`: All audit records are deleted. </li></ul>    The default value is `TRUE`. We recommend that you retain the default value to avoid deleting records unexpectedly.  |



## Considerations

The `CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL` procedure is usually called after the `SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP` procedure. The `SET_LAST_ARCHIVE_TIMESTAMP` procedure sets the last archive timestamp of audit records.

## Examples

The following example calls the `CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL` procedure to delete all audit trail records that are updated before the last archive timestamp:

```sql
BEGIN
   DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.CLEAN_AUDIT_TRAIL(
      audit_trail_type         =>  DBMS_AUDIT_MGMT.AUDIT_TRAIL_ALL,
      use_last_arch_timestamp  =>  TRUE);
END;
```
