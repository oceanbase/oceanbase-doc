# DEFINE_COLUMN

The `DEFINE_COLUMN` stored procedure defines the column to be selected from a specified cursor. This procedure is only used with `SELECT` cursors.

The column to define is identified by its relative position in the `SELECT` list of the statement in the specified cursor.  The type of the column parameter determines the type of the column to define.

## Syntax

```sql
DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN (c IN INTEGER,
                          position IN INTEGER,
                          column IN NUMBER);                    

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN (c IN INTEGER,
                          position IN INTEGER,
                          column IN VARCHAR2);      

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN (c IN INTEGER,
                          position IN INTEGER,
                          column IN VARCHAR2,
                          column_size IN INTEGER);      

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN(c in integer,
                          position in integer,
                          column in date);

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN(c in integer,
                          position in integer,
                          column in binary_float);      

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN(c in integer,
                          position in integer,
                          column in binary_double);    

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN(c in integer,
                          position in integer,
                          column in blob);  

DBMS_SQL.DEFINE_COLUMN(c in integer,
                          position in integer,
                          column in raw,
                          column_size IN INTEGER);                           
```



## Parameters



| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| c | The ID of the cursor for the row that is being defined to be selected.  |
| position | The relative position of the column in the row that is being defined. This first column in a statement has position 1.  |
| column | The value of the column to define.  The type of this value determines the type of the column to define.  |
| column_size | The maximum size of the column value in bytes.  |



## Considerations

When you use character length semantics, the maximum number of bytes that can be returned for a column value of the VARCHAR2 type is calculated as: column_size × maximum character byte size of the current character set.

For example, if `column_size` is set to 10, a maximum of 30 (10 × 3) bytes can be returned when you use the character length semantics with a UTF-8 character set, regardless of the number of characters this represents.
