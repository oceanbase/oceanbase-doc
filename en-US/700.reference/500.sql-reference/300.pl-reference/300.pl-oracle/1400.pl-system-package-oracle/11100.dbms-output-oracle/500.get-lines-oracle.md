## Syntax


```sql
DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINES (
   lines           OUT     CHARARR,
   numlines    IN OUT  INTEGER);

DBMS_OUTPUT.GET_LINES (
   lines           OUT     DBMSOUTPUT_LINESARRAY,
   numlines    IN OUT INTEGER);
```



## Parameters



| Parameter | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| lines | The buffered information returned in multiple lines. Each line is up to 32,767 bytes in length.  |
| numlines | The number of lines to be retrieved from the buffer. After the specified number of lines are retrieved, the stored procedure returns the number of lines actually retrieved. If the returned number is less than the number of lines requested, then there are no more lines in the buffer.  |



## Considerations

* The stored procedure can retrieve one or multiple lines from the buffer. You can call the `GET_LINE` stored procedure to retrieve a single line of buffered information. The `GET_LINES` stored procedure reduces the number of calls to the server.



* After you call the `GET_LINE` or `GET_LINES` stored procedure, lines that are not retrieved will be discarded before the next call to the `PUT`, `PUT_LINE`, or `NEW_LINE` stored procedure, to avoid conflicts with future information.
