# Overview

OceanBase Database provides procedural language (PL) system packages to extend database functionality and provide access to SQL features by using PL statements.

You can use the system packages provided when you create your own stored procedures and applications. This manual describes the system packages supported by the current OceanBase Database server version.

A system package is an encapsulated collection of related program objects stored in the database. A program object can be a stored procedure, a function, a variable, a constant, a cursor, or an exception.

You can execute the following statement as a user with sufficient privileges to view the supported system packages and their information:

```sql
SELECT * FROM DBA_SOURCE;
```

You can execute the following statement to query information about a specific system package:

```sql
SELECT * FROM DBA_SOURCE WHERE NAME ='pl_package_name';
```

## Composition of a PL system package

A PL system package consists of two parts: the package specification (`SPECIFICATION`) and the package body (`BODY`). The package specification is the interface to applications. It declares public items visible to applications, including types, variables, constants, exceptions, cursors, and subprograms. The package body contains implementation details and private declarations invisible to applications. It completely defines cursors and subprograms to support the implementation of the package specification.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The current OceanBase Database version does not allow you to modify system packages. </p>

## Usage of PL system packages

System packages supplied with OceanBase Database are automatically installed when you create a database.

## Overview of PL system packages

The following table describes the PL system packages supported by the current OceanBase Database version.
