# RECOVER TABLE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to restore a specified table from the backup data to an existing tenant, which can be the original tenant to which the table belongs or a different tenant that is located in the same or a different cluster as the original tenant.

## Limitations and considerations

* You can restore only a user table. You cannot independently restore a temporary table, view, or index.

* You cannot restore foreign keys, triggers, or statistics of a table.

* The source tenant of the table to be restored and the destination tenant must be of the same type. For example, both are Oracle tenants or both are MySQL tenants.

* You can restore a table only to an OceanBase database of the same or a later version.

* The specified table name must be consistent with that stored in the system. For example, assume that you have created a table named `test` in an Oracle tenant, which is stored by the name of `TEST` in the system. To restore this table, you must specify the table name `TEST`. Otherwise, the system will report an error indicating that the table does not exist.

* An auxiliary tenant is required when you use the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER TABLE` statement to restore a table. Therefore, before you execute the statement, you must create a resource pool for the auxiliary tenant in the cluster where the destination tenant resides. For more information about how to create a resource pool for an auxiliary tenant, see [Preparations](../../../../../600.manage/600.backup-and-recovery/700.recover-table/100.preparation-before-table-recovery.md).

## Required privileges

You can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER TABLE` statement only as the `root` user of the `sys` tenant (namely `root@sys`).

## Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM
    RECOVER TABLE table_name_list
    TO [TENANT [=]] dest_tenant_name
    FROM uri [ UNTIL {TIME ='timestamp'}| {SCN = scn} ]
    WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password']
    [REMAP TABLE remap_table_name_list]
    [REMAP TABLEGROUP remap_tablegroup_list]
    [REMAP TABLESPACE remap_tablespace_list]
    [DESCRIPTION [=] description];

table_name_list:
    database_name.table_name [, database_name.table_name ...]

remap_table_name_list:
    /* Retain the database name and change only the table name. */
    database_name.old_table_name:new_table_name
    /* Retain the table name and change only the database name. */
    |old_database_name.table_name:new_database_name.table_name
    /* Change both the database name and table name. */
    | old_database_name.old_table_name:new_database_name.new_table_name
    /* Restore all tables in the source database to the new database. */
    | old_database_name.`*`:new_database_name.`*`

remap_tablegroup_list:
    old_tablegroup_name:new_tablegroup_name

remap_tablespace_list:
    old_tablespace_name:new_tablespace_name
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|----------------------|----------------------|
| table_name_list | The tables to be restored, in the format of `database_name.table_name1,database_name.table_name2,...`. Separate multiple tables with commas (,). <ul><li>The specified table name must be consistent with that stored in the system. For example, assume that you have created a table named `test` in an Oracle tenant, which is stored by the name of `TEST` in the system. To restore this table, you must specify the table name `TEST`. Otherwise, the system will report an error indicating that the table does not exist. </li> <li>To restore all tables in a database, you can replace `table_name` with an asterisk (\*), that is, `database_name.*`. </li> <li>To restore all tables in all databases, replace both `database_name` and `table_name` with an asterisk (\*), that is, `*.*`. </li><li>If either `database_name` or `table_name` contains a special character, enclose the special character in backticks (``). </li></ul> |
| dest_tenant_name | The name of the destination tenant. The current version allows you to restore tables only to user tenants.  |
| uri | The path to which data backups and log archives are transferred. If the data backup is initiated by using the `PLUS ARCHIVELOG` clause, you need to specify only one path. Otherwise, you need to specify at least one data backup path and one log archive path, for example, `'file:///backup/archive, file:///backup/data'`. For more information about data backup modes, see [BACKUP](600.backup.md).  |
| UNTIL | The timestamp or system change number (SCN) to which data is restored. To restore to a specified TIME or SCN value, join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`). By default, if you do not specify the `UNTIL` clause, the tenant is restored to the latest timestamp or SCN. <ul><li>`TIME ='timetamp'`: the timestamp to which the table is to be restored. </li>  <li>`SCN = scn`: the SCN to which the table is to be restored. </li></ul> |
| restore_option | The restore options of the auxiliary tenant, including `pool_list`, `locality`, `primary_zone`, and `concurrency`. Separate the options with ampersands (`&`). <ul><li>`pool_list`: required. The resource pool of the tenant. Multiple resource pools must be separated with commas (,). </li>  <li>`locality`: optional. The locality that indicates the distribution of replicas of the auxiliary tenant, which must match the zone information of `pool_list` of the cluster where the auxiliary tenant is located. By default, if this option is not specified, a full-featured replica is set for each zone in `zone_list` of the resource pools specified by `pool_list`. </br>Example: `locality='F@z1,F@z2,F@z3'`  </li>  <li> `primary_zone`: optional. The preferred locations of leaders of the auxiliary tenant, which must match the settings of `pool_list` and `locality`, namely, match the zone information and meet the constraints such as that the primary region contain at least two Paxos members. If this option is not specified, the system randomly distributes leaders in the zones specified by `zone_list` of `locality`.  </br>Example: `primary_zone='z1'` </li> <li>`concurrency`: optional. The concurrency for restore. If `concurrency` is not specified, the `MAX_CPU` value assigned to the auxiliary tenant is used as the default value. </br>Example: `concurrency=50`.</li></ul> |
| WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password' | Optional. The key backup information of the encrypted tenant. You need to specify the key backup information for a tenant restore only when the tenant is configured with transparent encryption.  <ul><li>`backup_key_path` indicates the backup path of the key. </li> <li>`password` indicates the encryption password specified during key backup. </li></ul> |
| REMAP | The mapping relationship. If you do not specify `REMAP`, the system tries to restore the table to the same table space, table group, and database as the original table.  |
| remap_table_name_list | The new name of the restored table. You can perform any of the following operations: rename the restored table without changing the database to which the table belongs, remap the restored table to another database without changing the table name, or rename the restored table and remap the table to another database. Use a colon (:) to join the source object and the renamed object.  </li></ul> |
| remap_tablegroup_list | The table group to which the restored table belongs. By default, if the source table is bound to a table group, the system restores the table to a table group with the same name in the destination tenant. If the table group with the same name does not exist, the table fails to be restored. If the destination tenant has other table groups, you can execute this statement to restore the table to another table group. Join the source object and the remapped-to object with a colon (:).  |
| remap_tablespace_list | The tablespace to which the restored table belongs. A tablespace is a logical unit in OceanBase Database mainly used for data encryption. By default, if the source table is bound to a tablespace, the system restores the table to the tablespace with the same name in the destination tenant. If the tablespace with the same name does not exist, the table fails to be restored. If the destination tenant has other tablespaces, you can execute this statement to restore the table to another tablespace. Join the source object and the remapped-to object with a colon (:).  |
| description | Optional. The description of the operation.  |

## Examples

For the `test` database in the MySQL tenant `obt`, the data backup path is set to `file:///data/backup/data`, the log archive path is set to `file:///data/backup/archive`, log archiving is enabled, and a full data backup is completed. Assume that the `student` table is dropped by mistake. The following example shows how to restore the `test.student` table in a tenant to the timestamp `2023-08-21 19:47:20` and rename the table as `student_recover`.

1. Create resources required by the auxiliary tenant in the sys tenant. This example creates the resource unit `recover_4c5g` and uses it to create a resource pool.

   1. Create a resource unit.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> CREATE RESOURCE UNIT recover_4c5g MAX_CPU 4, MEMORY_SIZE = '5G', MAX_IOPS 1024, MIN_IOPS=1024;
      ```

   2. Create a resource pool.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> CREATE RESOURCE POOL recover_tmp_pool UNIT = 'recover_4c5g', UNIT_NUM = 1, ZONE_LIST = ('z1','z2','z3');
      ```

2. Restore the `student` table to the `test` database under the `obt` tenant and rename the table as `student_recover`. The backup path is `file:///data/backup/data`, the log archive path is `file:///data/backup/archive`, the table is restored to the timestamp `2023-08-21 19:47:20`, the resource pool used by the auxiliary tenant is `recover_tmp_pool`, and the primary zone is `z1`.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER TABLE test.student TO TENANT obt FROM 'file:///data/backup/data,file:///data/backup/archive' UNTIL TIME='2023-08-21 19:47:20' WITH 'pool_list=recover_tmp_pool&primary_zone=z1' REMAP TABLE test.student:student_recover;
   ```

3. After the table restore statement is executed, you can check the restore progress in the `CDB_OB_RECOVER_TABLE_JOBS` view. The `STATUS` field indicates the restore stage. In this example, the stage is `RESTORE_AUX_TENANT`, which means that the auxiliary tenant is being restored.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_RECOVER_TABLE_JOBS\G
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
