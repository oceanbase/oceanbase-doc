# SET ROLE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to enable or disable a role granted to the current session.

## Syntax

```sql
SET ROLE
{ role_name [ IDENTIFIED BY password ][, role_name [ IDENTIFIED BY password ] ]...
| ALL [ EXCEPT role_name [, role_name ]... ]
| NONE
} ;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| role_name | The name of the role to be enabled or disabled for the current session.  |
| IDENTIFIED BY password | The password of the role. If the role has a password, you must specify this parameter. Otherwise, the role cannot be enabled or disabled.  |
| ALL | Enables all roles granted to the current session. The `EXCEPT` clause specifies the roles excluded. This clause is optional. If you are directly granted any role with a password, this clause cannot be specified. Otherwise, an error is reported.  |
| NONE | Disables all roles of the current session.  |

## Examples

* Enable `role1` identified by the password `**1***` for the current session.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET ROLE role1 IDENTIFIED BY **1***;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Enable all roles granted to the current session. An error is reported if any granted role has a password.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET ROLE ALL;
   ORA-01979: missing or invalid password for role 'ROLE2'
   ```

* Enable all roles granted to the current session except `role2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET ROLE ALL EXCEPT role2;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Disable all roles granted to the current session.

   ```sql
   obclient> SET ROLE NONE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
