# CREATE USER

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create an OceanBase Database user. After you create a user, you can use it to connect to OceanBase Database.

## Required privileges

You must have the `CREATE USER` system privilege to use the `CREATE USER` statement. For more information about OceanBase Database privileges, see [Privilege types in Oracle mode](../../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/000.permission-classification-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE USER user_name
    IDENTIFIED BY [VALUES] password
    [REQUIRE {NONE | SSL | X509 | tls_option}]
    [PROFILE profile_name]
    [DEFAULT TABLESPACE tablespace_name]
    [PRIMARY_ZONE [=] primary_zone];

tls_option:
      CIPHER cipher_name
    | ISSUER issuer_name
    | SUBJECT subject_name
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| user_name | The username. For each user created, a new entry is created in the `dba_users` table. If the username already exists, an error is returned.  |
| IDENTIFIED BY | The password in plaintext for the user, which is then saved to the `dba_users` table in ciphertext. If the password contains special characters, it must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks. Special characters are <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>  |
| IDENTIFIED BY VALUES | The password in ciphertext for the user, which is saved to the `dba_users` table directly.  |
| REQUIRE | The authentication requirements for the user. Valid values: <ul><li>`NONE`: There is no authentication requirement. In this case, the user can use any password or no password. </li><li>`SSL`: The user must use an SSL connection for authentication. </li><li>`X509`: The user must use an X509 certificate for authentication. </li><li>`tls_option`: The user must meet the specified Transport Layer Security (TLS) requirements. </li></ul> |
| tls_option | The options for TLS requirements. Valid values: <ul><li>`CIPHER`: the encryption algorithm or cipher suite used for the TLS connection. </li><li>`ISSUER`: the issuer of the TLS certificate. </li><li>`SUBJECT`: the subject of the TLS certificate. </li></ul> |
| PROFILE | The user profile, which is a set of predefined privileges and restrictions applicable to the user to be created.  |
| DEFAULT TABLESPACE | The default tablespace for the user. A tablespace is a logical structure that stores user data.  |
| primary_zone | The primary zone. Valid values:<ul><li>`DEFAULT`: The default primary zone is used. </li><li>`RANDOM`: A zone is randomly selected as the primary zone if no primary zone name is specified. </li><li>`zone_name`: The primary zone name, which can be a relation name or a string that uniquely identifies the primary zone. </li></ul> |

## Examples

* Create a user named `test1` and specify a plaintext password.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> CREATE USER test1 IDENTIFIED BY "********";
   ```

* Create a user named `test2`, specify a ciphertext password, and specify that the user must use an SSL connection for authentication.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> CREATE USER test2 IDENTIFIED BY VALUES "********" REQUIRE SSL;
   ```

* Create a user named `test3` and specify a random primary zone.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> CREATE USER test3 IDENTIFIED BY "********" PRIMARY_ZONE=RANDOM;
   ```
