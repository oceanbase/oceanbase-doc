# CREATE SEQUENCE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a sequence. A sequence is a database object. You can generate a unique integer from a sequence.

If two users increment the same sequence concurrently, the sequence numbers obtained by the two users have an interval. One user can never obtain the sequence number generated by the other user. Sequence numbers are generated independently of the table. Therefore, you can use the same sequence for multiple tables.

After creating a sequence, you can use the `CURRVAL` pseudocolumn to return the current sequence value or use the `NEXTVAL` pseudocolumn to return the new increment value in the SQL statement. For more information, see [Sequence pseudocolumns](../../../200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/300.sequence-pseudo-column-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE [ schema. ] sequence_name
{ START WITH int_value
|[ INCREMENT BY int_value ]
|[ MINVALUE int_value | NOMINVALUE ]
|[ MAXVALUE int_value | NOMAXVALUE ]  
|[ CACHE int_value | NOCACHE ]
|[ ORDER | NOORDER ]
|[ CYCLE | NOCYCLE ]  
}
;
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| schema. | The schema where the sequence resides. If this parameter is not specified, the database creates the sequence in the schema of the current user.  |
| sequence_name | The name of the sequence to be created.  |
| MINVALUE int_value | The minimum value of the sequence. Value range of `int_value`: \[-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775807\].  |
| NOMINVALUE | `NOMINVALUE` is the default value. If `NOMINVALUE` is specified, the minimum value is 1 when the sequence ascends and is -9223372036854775808 when the sequence descends.  |
| MAXVALUE int_value | The maximum value of the sequence. Value range of `int_value`: \[-9223372036854775808,9223372036854775807\]<br>  **Notice**  <ul><li> When `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` are both specified, `MINVALUE` must be smaller than `MAXVALUE`. </li>   <li>  The difference between `MAXVALUE` and `MINVALUE` must be greater than or equal to `INCREMENT BY int_value`. </li>  </ul> |
| NOMAXVALUE | `NOMAXVALUE` is the default value. If `NOMAXVALUE` is specified, the maximum value is 9223372036854775807 when the sequence ascends or -1 when the sequence descends.  |
| START WITH int_value | The start value of the sequence. `int_value` must be smaller than or equal to `MAXVALUE`, and greater than or equal to `MINVALUE`. If no start value is specified, the start value is the minimum value for an ascending sequence and the maximum value for a descending sequence.  |
| INCREMENT BY int_value | The increment of the sequence. `int_value` cannot be 0. If the value is positive, the sequence ascends. If the value is negative, the sequence descends. If this parameter is not specified, the default value is 1.  |
| CACHE int_value | The number of sequence values pre-allocated in the memory. By default, `int_value` is 20. The value of `CACHE int_value` must be greater than 1. If the value of `CACHE int_value` is 1, it is equivalent to `NOCACHE`.  |
| NOCACHE | Specifies that no sequence values are pre-allocated. If neither `CACHE` nor `NOCACHE` is specified, the database caches 20 sequence values by default.  |
| ORDER | Specifies that sequence values are generated in order.  |
| NOORDER | `NOORDER` is the default value, which means it is not assured that sequence values are generated in order.  |
| CYCLE | Specifies that sequence values are generated cyclically. That is, when the sequence reaches its maximum or minimum value, new sequence values will also be generated. If the sequence ascends and reaches its maximum value, the minimum sequence value will be generated. If the sequence descends and reaches its minimum value, the maximum sequence value will be generated.  <br>**Notice**  <ul><li> If `CYCLE` is specified and the value of `INCREMENT BY int_value` is smaller than 0, `MINVALUE` must be specified. </li>   <li> If `CYCLE` is specified, the number of values in the cache cannot be greater than the number of values in the cycle. </li></ul> |
| NOCYCLE | `NOCYCLE` is the default value. If it is specified, no more values are generated when the sequence reaches its maximum or minimum value.  |

## Examples

Create a sequence named `seq1` in the `test` schema and set the increment to 2. In the following example, 1 is returned for the first reference to `seq1.nextval`, and 3 is returned for the second reference. The return value of each subsequent reference is greater than that of the previous reference by 2.

```sql
obclient> CREATE SEQUENCE test.seq1 START WITH 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 10 INCREMENT BY 2 NOCYCLE NOORDER CACHE 30;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT seq1.nextval FROM DUAL;
+--------+
| nextval|
+--------+
| 1      |
+--------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT seq1.nextval FROM DUAL;
+--------+
| nextval|
+--------+
| 3      |
+--------+
1 row in set
```
