## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| hint_options | Optional. The hint options.  |
| DISTINCT \| UNIQUE \| ALL | The returned data may contain duplicate rows.  <ul><li> If you specify `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE`, rows are deduplicated in the query results. `DISTINCT` and `UNIQUE` are synonyms.    </li><li> If you specify `ALL`, all rows are returned in the query results. The default value is `ALL`.  |
| select_expr_list | The expression or names of columns to query from the database. Separate multiple names with commas (,). The value "\*" indicates all columns.  <ul><li> `table_name.*`: all columns in the specified table or view.    </li><li> `table_alias_name.`: the alias of the table or view.    </li><li> `expr [[AS] column_alias_name]`: the alias of the column or expression that you want to query. `AS` is optional.  </li></ul> |
| FROM table_references | The object from which data is selected.  |
| PARTITION(partition_list) | The partitions from which data is selected in the table. For example, you can set this parameter to `PARTITION(p0,p1…)`.  |
| table_factor | The name of the table (base table or updatable view) or special subquery. Function-based queries are supported.  |
| table_alias_name | The alias of the object from which data is selected.  |
| joined_table | The join method in a multi-table query.  <ul><li> `[INNER] JOIN` indicates inner join and `INNER` is optional. Only the data that meets the join conditions is returned.    </li><li> `[OUTER] JOIN` indicates outer join and `OUTER` is optional.  </li><li> `LEFT [OUTER]` indicates left (outer) join. The values of all public columns in the table on the left side are returned.    </li><li> `RIGHT [OUTER]` indicates right (outer) join. The values of all public columns in the table on the right side are returned.    </li><li> `FULL [OUTER]` indicates full (outer) join. The rows that are not returned in the inner join results of two tables are reserved and filled with null values.  </li></ul> |
| ON expression | The join condition in a multi-table join.  |
| WHERE where_conditions | Optional. The filter condition. Only data that meets the condition is returned in the query results. `where_conditions` is an expression.  |
| GROUP BY group_by_list | The grouping field, which is usually used together with aggregate functions.  <br>**Note**: If no column following the `SELECT` clause uses any aggregate function, in a GROUP BY query, the columns following the `SELECT` clause must be specified in the `GROUP BY` clause.</br>  |
| ROLLUP group_expression_list | Rolls up the results of the groups created by the GROUP BY clause and generates the statistics.  |
| CUBE group_expression_list | Unions all combinations of the items in the expression list, uses `GROUP BY` to group the union results, and generates the statistics. **<br>Note:**<ul><li>The items specified in `select_expr_list` must also be included in `CUBE expression_list`. </li> <li>In the `GROUP BY` clause, you can specify multiple `CUBE` extensions and multiple other `GROUP BY` extensions, such as `ROLLUP` and `GROUPING SETS`. The syntax is `SELECT select_expr_list FROM ... GROUP BY [...] CUBE (group_expression_list[, group_expression_list...]) [, ...]`.  </li><li>If you do not specify the `ORDER BY` clause, the order of the result set is not guaranteed. </li> <li>The number of group levels or the total number of groups is the `n` power of 2, where `n` indicates the number of items in the `CUBE` expression list. That is, the number of groups increases exponentially with the number of expression items. Therefore, we recommend that you do not use the `CUBE` expression when the number of expression items is large. </li> </ul> |
| GROUPING SETS group_expression_list | Specifies two or more data groups in a query, generates statistics, and aggregates and displays the statistics of the specified group. You can specify a single field or a list of fields in `GROUPING SETS`.  |
| HAVING search_conditions | Filters the grouped data. The `HAVING` clause is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but the `HAVING` clause can reference an aggregate function such as `SUM()` and `AVG()`.  |
| ORDER BY order_list | Sorts the query results by one or multiple columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. If you do not specify `ASC` or `DESC`, the default value `ASC` prevails.  <ul><li> `ASC` indicates ascending order.     </li><li> `DESC` indicates descending order.  </li></ul> |
| row_limiting_clause | Restricts the rows returned by a query, to implement querying by page. You can specify the offset and the number of rows or percentage of rows to return. It can be used together with the `ORDER BY` clause to ensure the sorting order, to obtain consistent results.  |
| OFFSET | The number of rows to skip before a query by page begins. `offset` must be a numeric value or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value.  <ul><li> If you specify a negative number, `offset` is taken as 0.    </li><li> If you set it to `NULL` or a value equal to or greater than the number of rows returned by the query, 0 rows are returned.    </li><li> If `offset` contains a fraction, the fraction is truncated.    </li><li> If this clause is not specified, the offset is 0 and pagination starts from the first row. </li></ul> |
| ROW \| ROWS | Indicates a single row or multiple rows. You can select the keyword based on the number of rows to ensure clear semantics.  |
| FETCH | The number of rows or percentage of rows to return. If this clause is not specified, all rows starting from the (`offset` + 1)th row are returned.  |
| FIRST \| NEXT | The number or percentage of rows to return in the first or next response.  |
| rowcount \| percent PERCENT | Use `rowcount` to specify the number of rows to return. `rowcount` must be a numeric value or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. If you specify a negative number, `rowcount` is taken as 0. If `rowcount` is greater than the number of available rows starting from the (`rowcount` +1)th row, all available rows are returned. If `rowcount` contains a fraction, the fraction is truncated. If `rowcount` is set to `NULL`, 0 rows are returned. Use `percent PERCENT` to specify the percentage of rows to return. `percent` must be a numeric value or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. If you specify a negative number, `percent` is taken as 0. If `percent` is set to `NULL`, 0 rows are returned. If you do not specify `rowcount` or `percent` `PERCENT`, one row is returned.  |
| ONLY \| WITH TIES | `ONLY` specifies the number of rows or the percentage of rows to return. `WITH TIES` specifies to return other rows that have the same sorting key as the last row obtained. If you use `WITH TIES`, you must specify the `ORDER BY` clause. If you do not specify the `ORDER BY` clause, no other rows will be returned.  |
| FOR UPDATE | Imposes an exclusive lock on all the rows in the query results to prevent other concurrent transactions from changing or reading the rows in some transaction isolation levels.  <ul><li> `OF column`: instructs the database to lock the rows of a particular table only (the table where the column specified by the `column` keyword is located) in multi-table joins.    </li><li> `WAIT`: instructs the database to wait for a period specified by `Integer` before locking the rows in the query result set. If any row in the result set has been locked by another session, the query fails afterward.    </li><li> `NOWAIT`: locks rows in the query result set. If any row in the result set is locked by another session, the query fails afterward.    </li><li> `SKIP LOCKED`: skips the rows in the result set that are locked by another session and returns the unlocked rows. </li></ul>  **Note**: `SKIP LOCKED` is not supported in a multi-table `join`.  |
| pivot_clause | Pivots a row to a column.  |
| aggregate_function | The aggregate function.  |
| expr | The expression whose calculation results are constant values. `pivot_in_clause` supports only constant expressions.  |
| unpivot_clause | Pivots a column to a row.  |
| dblink_name | The name of the database link (DBLink) to be accessed.  |
| sequence_name | The sequence in the remote database to be accessed over the DBLink. The `NEXTVAL` and `CURRVAL` values of the `SEQUENCE` object can be accessed.  |

   * Query the three employees with the smallest employee IDs (`empno`) again.

      ```sql
      obclient> SELECT empno, empname
      FROM emp
      ORDER BY empno
      FETCH NEXT 3 ROWS ONLY;
      ```

   * Query the 25% of employees with the lowest salaries.

      ```sql
      obclient> SELECT empno, empname sal FROM emp ORDER BY sal
       FETCH FIRST 25 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;
      +-------+-------+
      | EMPNO | SAL   |
      +-------+-------+
      |  1499 | ALLEN |
      |  1698 | BLAKE |
      +-------+-------+
      2 rows in set
      ```

   * Query the 25% of employees with the lowest salaries and all other employees with the same salary as the last employee returned in the previous example.

      ```sql
      obclient> SELECT empno, empname sal FROM emp ORDER BY sal
       FETCH FIRST 25 PERCENT ROWS WITH TIES;
      +-------+-------+
      | EMPNO | SAL   |
      +-------+-------+
      |  1499 | ALLEN |
      |  1698 | BLAKE |
      +-------+-------+
      2 rows in set
      ```

* Use the alias of the `t1` table to query data from the table.

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT );
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES ('1','2');
   Query OK, 1 row affected

   obclient> SELECT * FROM (t1) a;
   +------+------+
   | C1   | C2   |
   +------+------+
   |    1 |    2 |
   +------+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* Use `RANDOM()` to generate random numbers and query data from the results of the `GENERATOR()` function directly after the `FROM` clause.

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT RANDOM(4) FROM GENERATOR(3);
   +---------------------+
   | RANDOM(4)           |
   +---------------------+
   | 5267436225003336391 |
   | -851690886662571060 |
   | 1738617244330437274 |
   +---------------------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

* Access sequence values in a remote database.

   1. Log on to the local OceanBase database and create a DBLink for connecting to a remote OceanBase database in Oracle mode.

        ```shell
        obclient> CREATE DATABASE LINK seq_link CONNECT TO test@oracle IDENTIFIED BY test HOST '127.xxx.xxx.xxx:2828';
        Query OK, 0 rows affected
        ```

   2. Create a sequence named `my_seq` in the remote OceanBase database.

        ```shell
        obclient> CREATE SEQUENCE my_seq START WITH 1 MINVALUE 1 MAXVALUE 10 INCREMENT BY 2 NOCYCLE NOORDER CACHE 30;
        Query OK, 0 rows affected
        ```

   3. Access the values of the sequence in the remote OceanBase database from the local database.

        ```shell
        obclient> SELECT my_seq.NEXTVAL@seq_link FROM DUAL;
        +---------+
        | NEXTVAL |
        +---------+
        |       1 |
        +---------+
        1 row in set

        obclient> SELECT my_seq.CURRVAL@seq_link FROM DUAL;
        +---------+
        | CURRVAL |
        +---------+
        |       1 |
        +---------+
        1 row in set

        obclient> SELECT my_seq.NEXTVAL@seq_link FROM DUAL;
        +---------+
        | NEXTVAL |
        +---------+
        |       3 |
        +---------+
        1 row in set
        ```
