# Overview

Like Oracle, OceanBase Database also supports datetime and interval data types. This topic describes the datetime and interval data types supported by OceanBase Database.

## Datetime data types

The datetime data types store date and time information. The following table lists the datetime data types supported by OceanBase Database.

| Data type | Description |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| DATE | The date and time, which is accurate to seconds and contains no time zone.  |
| TIMESTAMP | It is an extended type of the `DATE` data type, which is accurate to nanoseconds and contains no time zone.  |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE | It is an extended type of the `DATE` data type, which is accurate to nanoseconds and contains the time zone.  |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | The `TIMESTAMP` with local time zone information, which stores database time zone.  |

## Interval data types

The interval data types store a period of time, unlike the datetime data types that store a specific point in time. The interval data types store the difference between two datetime values. The following table lists the interval data types.

| **Data type** | **Description** |
|------------------------|----------------------|
| INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH | The time interval in years and months.  |
| INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND | The time interval in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.  |

## Related fields and values

Datetime and interval data consist of fields, and the values of these fields decide the value of the data types.

| Field | Value range of datetime | Value range of interval |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `YEAR` | [-4712,9999], excluding year 0. | Any positive or negative integer.  |
| `MONTH` | [01,12] | [0,11] |
| `DAY` | [01,31]. The value range is determined by the values of `MONTH` and `YEAR` and complies with the rule of the NLS calendar. | Any positive or negative integer.  |
| `HOUR` | [00,23] | [0,23] |
| `MINUTE` | [00,59] | [0,59] |
| `SECOND` | [00,59.9(n)], where `9(n)` is the precision of time fractional seconds. `9(n)` does not apply to `DATE`.  | [0,59.9(n)], where `9(n)` is the precision of interval fractional seconds.  |
| `TIMEZONE_HOUR` | [-12,14]. This range applies to daylight saving time and does not apply to `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`.  | N/A |
| `TIMEZONE_MINUTE` | [00,59]. This range does not apply to `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`.  | N/A |
| `TIMEZONE_REGION` | You can query the `TZNAME` column of the `V$TIMEZONE_NAMES` data dictionary view to get the value range. This range does not apply to `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`.  | N/A |
| `TIMEZONE_ABBR` | You can query the `TZABBREV` column of the `V$TIMEZONE_NAMES` data dictionary view to get the value range. This range does not apply to `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`.  | N/A |
