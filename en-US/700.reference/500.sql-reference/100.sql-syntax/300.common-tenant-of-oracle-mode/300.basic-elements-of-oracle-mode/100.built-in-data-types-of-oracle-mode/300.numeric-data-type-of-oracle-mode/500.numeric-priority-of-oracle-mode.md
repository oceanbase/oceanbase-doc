# Precedence of numeric data types

Different numeric data types have different priorities. This topic describes precedence rules and considerations for numeric data types in OceanBase Database.

The `BINARY_DOUBLE` data type has the highest precedence, followed by `BINARY_FLOAT`, and then by `NUMBER`.

In an operation on values of different data types, the following conversion rules apply:

* If one of the operands is of the `BINARY_DOUBLE` data type, OceanBase Database converts all operands to the `BINARY_DOUBLE` data type before the operation.

* If one of the operands is of the `BINARY_FLOAT` data type and no operand of the `BINARY_DOUBLE` data type exists, OceanBase Database converts all operands to the `BINARY_FLOAT` data type before the operation.

* If no operand is of the `BINARY_DOUBLE` or `BINARY_FLOAT` data type, OceanBase Database converts all operands to the `NUMBER` data type before the operation.

    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>If the conversion fails, the operation fails. </li>
    <li>The numeric data types have lower precedence than datetime and interval data types but higher precedence than character data types and all other data types. </li>
    </ul>
