# OB_TRANSACTION_ID

## Syntax

```sql
OB_TRANSACTION_ID()
```

## Purpose

* If the current session is in an active transaction, this function returns the integer value of the transaction ID, which is greater than 0.
* If the current session is not in an active transaction, this function returns 0.

## Examples

1. Start a transaction.

    ```shell
    obclient [SYS]> START TRANSACTION;
    ```

2. Query the ID of the transaction that is active.

    ```shell
    obclient [SYS]> SELECT OB_TRANSACTION_ID() FROM DUAL;
    ```

    The result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +---------------------+
    | OB_TRANSACTION_ID() |
    +---------------------+
    |            11003721 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set
    ```

3. Commit the transaction.

    ```shell
    obclient [SYS]> COMMIT;
    ```

4. Query the ID of the transaction that is not active.

    ```shell
    obclient [SYS]> SELECT OB_TRANSACTION_ID() FROM DUAL;
    ```

    The result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +---------------------+
    | OB_TRANSACTION_ID() |
    +---------------------+
    |                   0 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set
    ```
