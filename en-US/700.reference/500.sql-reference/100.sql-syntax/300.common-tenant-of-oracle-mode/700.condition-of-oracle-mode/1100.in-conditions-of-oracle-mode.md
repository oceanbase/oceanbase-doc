# IN condition

The IN condition is a membership condition. It is used to test a value for membership in a list of values or subquery.

The syntax of the IN condition is as follows:

```sql
expr [ NOT ] IN  ({ expression_list | subquery })
|( expr [, expr ]... ) [ NOT ]  IN  ( { expression_list [, expression_list ]...
                                      | subquery } )
```

The `IN` condition can test whether one or multiple expressions are members of an expression list or a subquery. The expressions in each expression list must match the expressions to the left of the `IN` operator in both number and data type. You can specify more than 1,000 expressions in `expression_list`.

The IN condition can be used in two forms.

* `IN` is equivalent to `=ANY`, indicating all members in the set. Here are some examples:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job_id IN ('PU_CLERK','SH_CLERK') ORDER BY emp_id;

   SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary IN (SELECT salary  FROM emp WHERE dept_id =30)
    ORDER BY emp_id;
   ```

* `NOT IN` is equivalent to `!= ALL`. If any member in the set is `NULL`, the calculation result is `FALSE`. Here are some examples:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM emp WHERE salary NOT IN (SELECT salary FROM emp WHERE dept_id = 30)
      ORDER BY emp_id;

   SELECT * FROM emp WHERE job_id NOT IN ('PU_CLERK', 'SH_CLERK') ORDER BY emp_id;
   ```

   If the calculation result of any item in the list following the `NOT IN` operation is `NULL`, the calculation results of all rows are `FALSE` or `UNKNOWN`, and no row is returned.
