# Floating-point conditions

A floating-point condition allows you to determine whether an expression is infinite or is the undefined result of an operation (not a number or NaN).

The syntax of floating-point conditions is as follows:

```sql
expr IS [ NOT ] { NAN | INFINITE }
```

In the two types of floating-point conditions, namely `{ NAN | INFINITE }`, `expr` must be parsed into a numeric data type or any data type that can be implicitly converted into a numeric data type.

The following table describes the floating-point conditions.

| Condition type | Operation | Example |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| IS \[NOT\] NAN | If `NOT` is not specified and `expr` is the special value NaN, TRUE is returned. If `NOT` is specified and `expr` is not NaN, TRUE is returned.  | `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM emp WHERE comm_pct IS NOT NAN;` |
| IS \[NOT\] INFINITE | If `NOT` is not specified and `expr` is the special value +INF or -INF, TRUE is returned. If `NOT` is specified and `expr` is not +INF or -INF, TRUE is returned.  | `SELECT last_name FROM emp WHERE salary IS NOT INFINITE;` |
