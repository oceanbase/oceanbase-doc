# TRANSACTION

## Purpose

You can use this statement to start a transaction.

A database transaction is a series of operations performed as a logical unit of work. A transaction can be used to maintain the integrity of the database by ensuring that SQL operations in a batch are either all executed or none of them are executed.

Explicit transactions are user-defined or user-specified transactions. You can explicitly start a transaction by using the `BEGIN` or `BEGIN WORK` statement (which is an alias of `START TRANSACTION`) and explicitly end the transaction by using the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement.

## Syntax

```sql
transaction_stmt:
      START TRANSACTION [READ ONLY | READ WRITE];
    | BEGIN [WORK];
    | COMMIT [WORK];
    | ROLLBACK [WORK];
    | SET TRANSACTION {READ ONLY | READ WRITE};
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| START TRANSACTION \[READ ONLY \| READ WRITE\] | Starts a transaction. After a transaction is started, the subsequent SQL data operation statements (such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`) do not take effect until it is explicitly committed. `READ ONLY` indicates that the transaction is started in read-only mode and modifications to the transaction are not allowed. `READ WRITE` indicates that the transaction is started in read and write mode, which is the default mode.  |
| BEGIN | `BEGIN` and `BEGIN WORK` are used as the alias of `START TRANSACTION`.  |
| COMMIT | Commits the current transaction.  |
| ROLLBACK | Rolls back the current transaction.  |
| SET TRANSACTION {READ ONLY \| READ WRITE} | Sets the current transaction to the `READ ONLY` or `READ WRITE` mode.  |

## Examples

* Assume that you have table `a` with the following data in your database.

   | id | name | num | sell_date |
   |----|------|-----|---------------------|
   | 1 | a | 100 | 2013-06-21 10:06:43 |
   | 2 | b | 200  | 2013-06-21 13:07:21 |
   | 3 | a | 50 | 2013-06-21 13:08:15 |

1. Execute the following statements in sequence to start the transaction, change the `name` value of the record whose `id` is `3` to `c`, and insert a row for the record of selling `a`.

   ```sql
   obclient> START TRANSACTION;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> UPDATE a SET name = 'c' WHERE id = 3;
   Query OK, 1 rows affected  

   obclient> INSERT INTO a VALUES (4, 'a', 30, '2013-06-21 16:09:13');
   Query OK, 1 rows affected  

   obclient> COMMIT;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

2. Commit the transaction and execute the following statement to query the information of table `a`.

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM a;
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   | id | name | num | sell_date |
   |----|------|-----|---------------------|
   | 1 | a | 100 | 2013-06-21 10:06:43 |
   | 2 | b | 200  | 2013-06-21 13:07:21 |
   | 3 | c | 50 | 2013-06-21 13:08:15 |
   | 4 | a | 30 | 2013-06-21 16:09:13 |

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Before a transaction is committed, you can view whether the operation in the transaction has taken effect. For example, you can execute the <code>SELECT * FROM a</code> statement before you commit a transaction. </li>
    <li>You can access the sessions of the current transaction to obtain the latest result. Access to sessions beyond the current transaction does not take effect. Before you <code>COMMIT</code> the transaction, your operations are visible only to the current transaction session. </li>
    <li>To roll back a transaction, replace <code>COMMIT</code> with <code>ROLLBACK</code>. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>
