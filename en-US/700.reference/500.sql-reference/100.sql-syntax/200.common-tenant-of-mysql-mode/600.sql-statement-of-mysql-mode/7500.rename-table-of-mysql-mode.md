# RENAME TABLE

## Purpose

You can use this statement to rename one or more tables.

To execute this statement, you must have the `ALTER` and `DROP` privileges on the original table and the `CREATE` and `INSERT` privileges on the new table.

## Limitations and considerations

* When the rename operation is in progress, the system automatically locks the process and prevents other threads from reading or writing the renamed tables until the operation is done.
* If a target table has any active transactions, the rename operation will wait for them to roll back or commit, and will not proceed until then.
* If you use this statement to rename multiple tables, the rename operation proceeds from left to right.
* Before you execute the `RENAME TABLE` statement, make sure that no target table is locked and no transaction is active on any target table.
* `RENAME TABLE` is also applicable to views, but you cannot execute this statement to move views across databases.

## Syntax

```sql
RENAME TABLE table_name TO [new_database_name.]new_table_name
[, table_name2 TO [new_database_name.]new_table_name2   ...];
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| table_name | The original table name.  |
| new_table_name | The new table name.  |
| table_name  TO \[new_database_name.\]new_table_name | Multiple table names must be separated with commas (,). You can specify `new_database_name` to move the table to another database.  |

## Examples

1. Create tables `t1` and `t2`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(c1 INT);
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t2(c1 INT);
   ```

2. Rename table `t1` as `t11`.

   ```sql
   obclient> RENAME TABLE t1 TO t11;
   ```

3. Rename table `t11` as `t111` and table `t2` as `t22`.

   ```sql
   obclient> RENAME TABLE t11 TO t111, t2 TO t22;
   ```

4. Move table `t22` to database `mysql`.

   ```sql
   obclient> RENAME TABLE t22 TO mysql.t22;
   ```
