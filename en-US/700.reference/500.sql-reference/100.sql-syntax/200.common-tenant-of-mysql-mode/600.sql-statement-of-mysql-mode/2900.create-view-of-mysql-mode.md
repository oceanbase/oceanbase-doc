# CREATE VIEW

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a view. If the `OR REPLACE` clause is specified, this statement can replace the existing view.

In a database, views do not exist as tables, but are derived from the execution results of the `SELECT` statement specified in the `CREATE VIEW` statement. A view is derived each time the statement is used.

If the `FROM` clause references two or more tables or views, the view is called a join view. An updatable join view, also known as a modifiable join view, involves two or more base tables or views and allows DML operations. Updatable views are not limited by the `WITH READ ONLY` clause.

A view must meet several criteria to be updatable. For example, a general rule is that an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` operation on a join view can modify only one base table at a time.

## Syntax

```sql
create_view_stmt:
  CREATE [OR REPLACE] VIEW view_name [(column_name_list)] AS select_stmt [WITH {LOCAL | CASCADED} CHECK OPTION];

column_name_list:
    column_name [, column_name ...]
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| OR REPLACE | Specifies to re-create a view that already exists by using a new definition.  |
| view_name | The name of the view.  |
| select_stmt | A `SELECT` statement that defines a view. You can use this statement to query base tables or other views.  |
| column_name_list | The column names in the view, which must be unique, like those in a base table. By default, the column names retrieved by the `SELECT` statement are used as the column names in the view. You can also use the optional `column_name_list` clause to define column names for a view. Separate multiple column names with commas (,). The number of column names in `column_name_list` must be equal to the number of columns retrieved by the `SELECT` statement. The `SELECT` statement can directly reference the columns of a table. You can also use functions, constants, and operators in the statement to retrieve columns.  |
| WITH CHECK OPTION | `WITH CHECK OPTION` ensures that the data inserted or updated to the view meets the conditions in the view definition. In the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, you can use the `WITH CHECK OPTION` clause together with the `LOCAL/CASCADED` keyword to further specify the data check scope. Differences between `LOCAL` and `CASCADED`:<ul><li> `WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION`: checks this view. Whether a referenced view is checked depends on the definition of the referenced view.    </li><li> `WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION`: checks this view and all referenced views recursively. </li></ul> |

## Examples

Select columns `c1` and `c2` from table `t` to create view `v`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v(vc1, vc2) AS SELECT c1, c2 FROM t;
```

Use `LOCAL CHECK OPTION` to create a view named `view1`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE test99(a int);
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.090 sec)

obclient> INSERT INTO test99 VALUES(0), (1), (2), (3);
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.046 sec)
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view1 AS SELECT * FROM test99 WHERE a > 0 WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.065 sec)
```

Use `CASCADED CHECK OPTION` to create a view named `view2` based on `view1`.

```sql
obclient> CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW view2 AS SELECT * FROM view1 WHERE a > 1 WITH CASCADED CHECK OPTION;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.073 sec)
```
