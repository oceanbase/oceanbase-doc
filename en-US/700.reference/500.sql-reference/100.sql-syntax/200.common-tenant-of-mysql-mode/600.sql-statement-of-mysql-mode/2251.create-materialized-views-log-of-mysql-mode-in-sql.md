# CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create a materialized view log. 

A materialized view log (mlog) records the incremental data updates of a user table, that is the base table of the materialized view, to support quick refresh of the materialized view. An `mlog` is a record table that tracks changes to the base table and applies these changes to the corresponding materialized view to achieve quick refresh of the materialized view. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>OceanBase Database does not support partitioning of an <code>mlog</code>. The partitions of an <code>mlog</code> are bound to those of the base table. </p>
</main>

## Required privileges

You need the `CREATE TABLE` privilege and the `SELECT` privilege on the base table to create a materialized view log. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md). 

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON [schema.] table [parallel_clause] [with_clause] [mv_log_purge_clause];

parallel_clause:
    NOPARALLEL 
    | PARALLEL integer

with_clause:
    WITH [ {PRIMARY KEY | ROWID | SEQUENCE} 
            [ { , PRIMARY KEY | , ROWID | , SEQUENCE }]... ] 
        (column_name [, column_name]...) 
        [new_values_clause]

new_values_clause:
    {INCLUDING | EXCLUDING} NEW VALUES

mv_log_purge_clause:
    PURGE {IMMEDIATE [ SYNCHRONOUS ]
        | START WITH datetime_expr [NEXT datetime_expr]
        | [START WITH datetime_expr] NEXT datetime_expr
        }
```

## Parameters

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| database. | The schema where the base table of the materialized view log is located. If you do not specify the `database.` parameter, the database in which you execute the statement is used by default.  |
| table | The name of the base table of the materialized view log.  |
| parallel_clause | Optional. The degree of parallelism (DOP) for processing materialized view logs. For more information, see [parallel_clause](#parallel_clause).  |
| with_clause | Optional. The columns attached to the materialized view log. Specifies whether to record the primary key and the row ID when the base table changes. You can also use this clause to add a sequence to provide additional sorting information for the materialized view log. For more information, see [with_clause](#with_clause).  |
| column_name | Optional. The name of the column that records the changed rows of the base table in the materialized view log.  |
| new_values_clause | Optional. Specifies whether to record both the old and new values before and after a data change in the materialized view log. For more information, see [new_values_clause](#new_values_clause).  |
| mv_log_purge_clause | Optional. The time to purge the data in the materialized view log. For more information, see [mv_log_purge_clause](#mv_log_purge_clause).  |

### parallel_clause

* `NOPARALLEL`: sets the DOP to `1`, which is the default value. 

* `PARALLEL integer`: sets the DOP to an integer greater than or equal to `1`. 

### with_clause

* `PRIMARY KEY`: specifies to record the primary key column of the base table in the materialized view log. This attribute takes effect only on a table with a primary key. If you do not specify this attribute, the system automatically adds this attribute to the materialized view log. In other words, the materialized view log contains the primary key column by default. 

* `ROWID`: specifies to record the row ID of the base table in the materialized view log. If you do not specify this attribute, the system automatically adds this attribute to the materialized view log. In other words, the materialized view log contains the `M_ROW$$` column by default. 

* `SEQUENCE`: specifies to record the sequential numbers of multiple rows updated in a transaction in the materialized view log. If you do not specify this attribute, the system automatically adds this attribute to the materialized view log. In other words, the materialized view log contains the `SEQUENCE$$` column by default. 

### new_values_clause

* `INCLUDING`: the default value, which specifies to record old and new values in the materialized view log. To perform the fast refresh of the materialized view, you must specify `INCLUDING NEW VALUES`. 

* `EXCLUDING`: specifies not to record new values in the materialized view log. Do not use `EXCLUDING NEW VALUES`. Otherwise, an error will be reported. 

### mv_log_purge_clause

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The corresponding data in the materialized view log is cleared only after the materialized view is refreshed. </p>
</main>

* `IMMEDIATE`: specifies to clear the corresponding materialized view log immediately after each refresh of the materialized view. The default value is `SYNCHRONOUS`. 
* `SYNCHRONOUS`: Optional. Specifies to perform cleanup synchronously. 
   
* `START WITH datetime_expr [NEXT datetime_expr]`:

   * `START WITH datetime_expr`: the time to clear the materialized view log for the first time. 
   * `[NEXT datetime_expr]`: Optional. The time to clear the materialized view log the next time.   

* `[START WITH datetime_expr] NEXT datetime_expr`: If you specify only `NEXT datetime_expr`, the materialized view log is cleared for the first time at the time specified by `NEXT datetime_expr`. 

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Make sure <code>START WITH datetime_expr</code> and <code>NEXT datetime_expr</code> are set to future points in time. Otherwise, an error will occur. </p>
</main>

We recommend that you use `sysdate()` to indicate the current time in the time zone. Here is an example of the time expression:

```sql
START WITH sysdate() NEXT sysdate() + INTERVAL 1 DAY
```

The preceding clause sets to clear expired materialized view log once every day, starting from the current time. 

## Example

1. Create a table named `test_tbl1`. 

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test_tbl1 (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(20), age INT);
   ```

2. Create a materialized view log on the `test_tbl1` table. Set the DOP of the materialized view log to `5`. Specify to record data changes to the `name` and `age` columns in the base table to the materialized view, including the old and new values before and after the change. Specify to clear expired log data once a day, starting from the current day. 

   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON test_tbl1 
     PARALLEL 5 
     WITH SEQUENCE(name ,age) INCLUDING NEW VALUES
     PURGE START WITH sysdate() NEXT sysdate() + INTERVAL 1 DAY;
   ```

3. Query the information of the materialized view log on the `test_tbl1` table. 

   ```sql
   DESC mlog$_test_tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------------+-------------+------+------+---------+-------+
   | Field      | Type        | Null | Key  | Default | Extra |
   +------------+-------------+------+------+---------+-------+
   | SEQUENCE$$ | bigint      | NO   | PRI  | NULL    |       |
   | id         | int(11)     | NO   |      | NULL    |       |
   | name       | varchar(20) | YES  |      | NULL    |       |
   | age        | int(11)     | YES  |      | NULL    |       |
   | DMLTYPE$$  | varchar(1)  | YES  |      | NULL    |       |
   | OLD_NEW$$  | varchar(1)  | YES  |      | NULL    |       |
   +------------+-------------+------+------+---------+-------+
   6 rows in set
   ```
