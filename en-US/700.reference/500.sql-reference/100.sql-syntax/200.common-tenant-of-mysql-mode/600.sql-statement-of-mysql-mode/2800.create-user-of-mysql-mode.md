# CREATE USER

## Purpose

You can use this statement to create an OceanBase Database user. After you create a user, you can use it to connect to OceanBase Database.

## Required privileges

You must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege to use the `CREATE USER` statement. For more information about privileges in OceanBase Database, see [Privilege types in MySQL mode](../../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/100.permission-classification-of-mysql.md).

## Syntax

```sql
CREATE USER [IF NOT EXISTS] {user [, user...]}
    [REQUIRE {NONE | SSL | X509 | tls_option}]
    [WITH resource_option [resource_option...]];

user:
      user_name
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY password
    | user_name IDENTIFIED [WITH auth_plugin] BY PASSWORD password

tls_option:
      CIPHER cipher_name
    | ISSUER issuer_name
    | SUBJECT subject_name

resource_option:
      MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR integer
    | MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS integer  
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-------|-----------|
| IF NOT EXISTS | Specifies not to create a user when the username already exists. If the username already exists and `IF NOT EXISTS` is not specified, an error is returned.  |
| user_name | The username. For each user created, a new entry is created in the `mysql.user` table. To create multiple users at a time, use commas (`,`) to separate them.  |
| auth_plugin | The user authentication method. Currently, only the `mysql_native_password` authentication plug-in is supported.  |
| IDENTIFIED BY password | The password in plaintext for the user, which is then saved to the `mysql.user` table in ciphertext. If the password contains special characters, it must be enclosed in single or double quotation marks. Special characters are <code>~!@#%^&*_-+=`\|(){}[]:;',.?/</code>.  |
| IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD password | The password in ciphertext for the user, which is saved to the `mysql.user` table directly.  |
| REQUIRE | The authentication requirements for the user. Valid values: <ul><li>`NONE`: There is no authentication requirement. In this case, the user can use any password or no password. </li><li>`SSL`: The user must use an SSL connection for authentication. </li><li>`X509`: The user must use an X509 certificate for authentication. </li><li>`tls_option`: The user must meet the specified Transport Layer Security (TLS) requirements. </li></ul> |
| tls_option | The options for TLS requirements. Valid values: <ul><li>`CIPHER`: the encryption algorithm or cipher suite used for the TLS connection. </li><li>`ISSUER`: the issuer of the TLS certificate. </li><li>`SUBJECT`: the subject of the TLS certificate. </li></ul> |
| resource_option | The resource options for the user. Separate multiple resource options with spaces. <ul><li>`MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR`: the maximum number of connections allowed per hour. The value must be an integer. </li><li>`MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS`: the maximum number of connections allowed per user. The value must be an integer. </li></ul> |

## Examples

* Create users named test1 and test2, and specify passwords in plaintext and the maximum number of concurrent connections allowed per user.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test1 IDENTIFIED BY '********', test2 IDENTIFIED BY '********' WITH MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 10;
   ```

* Create a user named test3, specify a password in ciphertext, and specify to use an SSL connection for authentication.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test3 IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD '********' REQUIRE SSL;
   ```

* Create a user named test4 and specify to use the mysql_native_password authentication plug-in.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS test4 IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY PASSWORD '********';
   ```
