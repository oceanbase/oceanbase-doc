# CHAR and VARCHAR


The `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` types are similar but differ in storage and retrieval methods, maximum length, and whether trailing spaces are preserved.

## CHAR


The length specified for the `CHAR` type is the maximum number of characters it can store. For example, `CHAR(30)` indicates that 30 characters can be stored.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
[NATIONAL] CHAR[(M)] [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
```

`CHARACTER SET` specifies the character set. If necessary, you can use `COLLATE` and other attributes to specify the collation of the character set. If the binary property of `CHARACTER SET` is specified, the column is created as the corresponding binary string data type, and the `CHAR` type changes to the `BINARY` type.

The length of a `CHAR` column can be any value from 0 to 255. When a `CHAR` value is stored, the value is right-padded with spaces to the specified length.

For `CHAR` columns, trailing spaces in inserted values are silently truncated, regardless of the SQL mode. When retrieving `CHAR` values, trailing spaces are removed unless the `PAD_CHAR_TO_FULL_LENGTH` SQL mode is enabled.

## VARCHAR

The length `M` specified for the `VARCHAR` type is the maximum number of characters it can store. For example, `VARCHAR(50)` indicates that 50 characters can be stored.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
[NATIONAL] VARCHAR(M) [CHARACTER SET charset_name] [COLLATE collation_name]
```

`CHARACTER SET` specifies the character set. If necessary, you can use `COLLATE` and other attributes to specify the collation of the character set. If the binary property of `CHARACTER SET` is specified, the column is created as a binary string column, and the `VARCHAR` type changes to the `VARBINARY` type.


The length of a `VARCHAR` column can be any value from 0 to 262,144.

Unlike `CHAR`, `VARCHAR` values are stored with a 1-byte or 2-byte length prefix plus data. The prefix indicates the number of bytes in the value. If the value does not exceed 255 bytes, it uses one byte; if it may exceed 255 bytes, it uses two bytes.

For `VARCHAR` columns, trailing spaces beyond the column length are truncated before insertion, generating a warning, regardless of the SQL mode.

`VARCHAR` values are not padded when stored. Per standard SQL, trailing spaces are preserved when storing and retrieving values.

In addition, OceanBase Database supports the extended `CHARACTER VARYING(m)` type, but we recommend that you use `VARCHAR(m)`.
