# IS_FREE_LOCK

## Purpose

`IS_FREE_LOCK()` checks whether the lock with the name given by `str` is free, that is, not held by other sessions. 

## Syntax

```sql
IS_FREE_LOCK('str')
```

## Description

### Parameters

`str`: the name of the lock to be checked. The value is a string. 

### Return value

* `1`: indicates that the lock is free, that is, no session is holding the lock. 

* `0`: indicates that the lock is not free, that is, a session is holding the lock. 

## Examples

Check whether the lock named `my_lock` is free. 

```shell
obclient [(none)]> SELECT IS_FREE_LOCK('my_lock');
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------+
| IS_FREE_LOCK('my_lock') |
+-------------------------+
|                       0 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set
```

`0` is returned, indicating that the lock `my_lock` is held by a session. You can use `IS_USED_LOCK()` to query the connection identifier (session ID) of the session that holds the lock. Here is an example:

```shell
obclient [(none)]> SELECT IS_USED_LOCK('my_lock');
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------+
| IS_USED_LOCK('my_lock') |
+-------------------------+
|              3221487701 |
+-------------------------+
1 row in set
```
