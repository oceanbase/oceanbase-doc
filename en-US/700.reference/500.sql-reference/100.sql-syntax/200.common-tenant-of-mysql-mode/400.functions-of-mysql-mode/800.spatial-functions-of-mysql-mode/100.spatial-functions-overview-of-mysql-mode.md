# Overview

OceanBase Database provides a set of spatial functions for processing geospatial data. You can use these functions to perform complex spatial queries and analysis at the database level. This enables the geographic information system (GIS) and other applications that rely on spatial data to efficiently store, query, and process spatial data.

The following table describes the spatial functions supported by OceanBase Database.

## Spatial functions

| Function type | Description |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Functions that create geometry values](150.create-a-geometry-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Create geometry objects, such as points, lines, and surfaces.  |
| [Spatial operation functions](200.spatial-operation-functions-of-mysql-mode.md) | Perform basic operations on geometry objects, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  |
| [Spatial relation functions](300.spatial-relation-functions-of-mysql-mode.md) | Test the spatial relations between two geometry objects, such as intersection, containment, and adjacency.  |
| [Geometry property functions](400.geometry-attribute-functions-of-mysql-mode.md) | Obtain properties of geometry objects, such as the area, length, and boundary.  |
| [Geometry format conversion functions](500.geometry-conversion-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Convert geometry values from one format to another format, for example, from the well-known text (WKT) format to the well-known binary (WKB) format.  |
| [Spatial analysis functions](600.spatial-analysis-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Perform complex spatial processing and analysis, such as buffer analysis, merging, and clipping.  |
| [Spatial constructor functions](700.spatial-constructor-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Construct new spatial data types and geometries.  |
| [Spatial accessor functions](800.spatial-accessor-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Provide access to spatial data components, such as the vertices of a polygon or the start point of a line.  |
| [Spatial format conversion functions](900.spatial-format-conversion-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Convert spatial data between different representation formats, such as converting geometry objects to the text or binary format.  |
| [Geometry processing functions](1000.spatial-processing-function-of-mysql-mode.md) | Operate or transform geometry objects, such as modifying shapes, calculating geometric relations, performing spatial queries, and conducting other spatial analysis.  |
