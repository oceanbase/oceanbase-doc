# Spatial analysis functions

Spatial analysis functions perform complex spatial processing and analysis, such as buffer analysis, merging, and clipping. 

OceanBase Database supports the following spatial analysis functions: `ST_Length()`, `ST_Centroid()`, and `_ST_PointOnSurface()`. 

## ST_Length

`ST_Length(ls[,unit])` calculates the length of a linear geometry, such as a line segment, polyline, or curve. This function is usually applied to `LINESTRING` and `MULTILINESTRING` objects. 

The unit conversion takes effect only when the geometry `ls` has an associated spatial reference identifier (SRID), and the SRID is not 0. An SRID of 0 usually indicates no SRS. 

The unit used must be a legal unit supported by the database, and the conversion factor of the unit must be identifiable to the database. 

The units and their conversion factors are as follows:

+--------------------------------------+---------------------+
```

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
ST_Length(ls[,unit])
```

where:

- `ls` indicates the input parameter that represents the linear geometry. 
- `unit` indicates the unit of length, which is optional. If this parameter is not specified, the default unit `metre` is used. Various length units such as `foot` and `centimetre` are accepted, depending on function implementation and the spatial database system. 

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SET @ls = ST_GeomFromText('LineString(1 1,2 2,3 3)', 4326);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT ST_Length(@ls, "foot");
+------------------------+
| ST_Length(@ls, "foot") |
+------------------------+
|     1029205.9131247795 |
+------------------------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT ST_Length(@ls);
+-------------------+
| ST_Length(@ls)    |
+-------------------+
| 313701.9623204328 |
+-------------------+
1 row in set
```

In this example, `ST_GeomFromText()` creates a linear geometry object (LineString) consisting of three points: (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3). 

Then, `ST_Length()` calculates the length of this LineString object. In the first function call, the length unit `foot` is specified. The length 1029205.9131247795 feet is returned. In the second call of `ST_Length()`, no unit is specified and the default unit `metre` is used. The length 313701.9623204328 meters is returned. 

## ST_Centroid

`ST_Centroid(geometry A)` calculates the mathematical centroid of the input geometry `A`. The centroid is the equilibrium point of each part of a geometry and can be regarded as the center of the geometry. For a two-dimensional geometry, such as a polygon, the centroid is the mean position of all points in the polygon. 

- If `A` is an empty geometry with no points, the function may return `NULL` or invalid results. 
- If `A` is a complex geometry, calculation of the centroid can become complex and intensive, especially for a geometry with many vertices or internal holes. 
- The centroid of a geometry may be outside the geometry, especially when the geometry has an irregular shape or a concave part. For example, for a U-shaped polygon, the centroid may be in the exterior to "U". 
- For a linear geometry, such as a line segment or a polyline, the centroid is the mean position of all points on the line. However, for complex lines such as self-intersecting or curved polylines, the centroid may be difficult to intuitively interpret. 

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
ST_Centroid(geometry A)
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT ST_AsText(_ST_PointOnSurface(geom)) AS pt_on_surf, ST_AsText(ST_Centroid(geom)) AS centroid FROM (SELECT ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 8, 2 8, 2 2, 10 2, 10 0, 0 0))') AS geom) AS t;
```

In this example, a polygon with a complex shape is determined and two kinds of spatial analysis operations are performed on the polygon.

`_ST_PointOnSurface()` obtains a point on the surface of the polygon. This point usually represents the location of the entire geometry and is in the interior of the polygon.
`ST_Centroid()` calculates the centroid of the polygon, which is the balance point of each part of the polygon but does not necessarily locate in the interior of the polygon.
The result is displayed in two columns. The first column `pt_on_surf` records the coordinates of a point on the surface of the polygon. The second column `centroid` records the coordinates of the polygon's centroid. The query result shows that the point on the polygon surface is (1 5), and the centroid is (4.076923076923077 5). 

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+------------+----------------------------+
| pt_on_surf | centroid                   |
+------------+----------------------------+
| POINT(1 5) | POINT(4.076923076923077 5) |
+------------+----------------------------+
1 row in set
```

## _ST_PointOnSurface

`_ST_PointOnSurface(geometry a)` returns a point on the surface of the input geometry `a`. The function returns a point that lies exactly in the interior of a geometry (polygon or another planar geometry), rather than the geometric or arithmetic center of the geometry. 

`_ST_PointOnSurface()` is usually meaningful only for planar geometries (such as polygons), because for linear or point geometries, the concept of interior points can be vague or inappropriate. 

The function may not return any of the interior points, but a specific point that may represent the entire geometry, for example, a vertex or a boundary point of a polygon. 

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
_ST_PointOnSurface(geometry g1)
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT ST_AsText(_ST_PointOnSurface(geom)) AS pt_on_surf, ST_AsText(ST_Centroid(geom)) AS centroid FROM (SELECT ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((0 0, 0 10, 10 10, 10 8, 2 8, 2 2, 10 2, 10 0, 0 0))') AS geom) AS t;
```

In this example, a polygon with a specific shape is created from a WKT string. Then, the polygon is analyzed by the `_ST_PointOnSurface()` and `ST_Centroid()` functions. 

`_ST_PointOnSurface()` returns a point on the surface of the polygon, that is, a point on the boundary or in the interior of the polygon. `ST_Centroid()` returns the centroid of the polygon. 

The result is displayed in two columns. The `pt_on_surf` column records the coordinates of a point on the surface, and the `centroid` column records the coordinates of the centroid. In this example, `pt_on_surf` records the point (1 5), while `centroid` records the point (4.076923076923077 5). 

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+------------+----------------------------+
| pt_on_surf | centroid                   |
+------------+----------------------------+
| POINT(1 5) | POINT(4.076923076923077 5) |
+------------+----------------------------+
1 row in set
```
