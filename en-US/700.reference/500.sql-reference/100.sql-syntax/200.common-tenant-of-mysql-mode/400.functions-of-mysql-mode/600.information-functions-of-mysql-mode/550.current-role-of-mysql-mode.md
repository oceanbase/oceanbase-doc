# CURRENT_ROLE

## Syntax

```sql
CURRENT_ROLE()
```

## Purpose

`CURRENT_ROLE()` returns the active roles of the current user in the current session. If `NONE` is returned, it indicates that the current user does not have any active roles. A user can use only privileges of its active roles. 

## Examples

```sql
obclient [(none)]> SELECT CURRENT_ROLE();
```

The return result is as follows:

```shell
+-----------------------------+
| CURRENT_ROLE()              |
+-----------------------------+
| `role002`@`%`,`role001`@`%` |
+-----------------------------+
1 row in set
```
