# OB_TRANSACTION_ID

## Syntax

```sql
OB_TRANSACTION_ID()
```

## Purpose

* If the current session is within an active transaction, the integer value of the transaction ID is returned, which is greater than 0.
* If the current session is not within an active transaction, 0 is returned.

## Examples

Query the transaction ID when the current session is within an active transaction.

1. Start a transaction.

    ```shell
    obclient [test]> BEGIN;
    ```

2. Query the current transaction ID.

    ```shell
    obclient [test]> SELECT OB_TRANSACTION_ID();
    ```

    The result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +---------------------+
    | OB_TRANSACTION_ID() |
    +---------------------+
    |            14565563 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set
    ```

3. Commit the transaction.

    ```shell
    obclient [test]> COMMIT;
    ```

4. Query the transaction ID when the current session is not within an active transaction.

    ```shell
    obclient [test]> SELECT OB_TRANSACTION_ID();
    ```

    The result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +---------------------+
    | OB_TRANSACTION_ID() |
    +---------------------+
    |                   0 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set
    ```
