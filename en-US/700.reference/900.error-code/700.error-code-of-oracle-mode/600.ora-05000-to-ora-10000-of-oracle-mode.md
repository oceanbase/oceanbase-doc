## ORA-06500: PL/SQL: storage error

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5842

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The PL program cannot allocate other storage. The program may be out of control.

* Solution:

   1. Make sure that the PL program does not use additional memory.

   2. Release unused objects through programming. For example, set them to `NULL`.

   3. Increase the size of the available shared or process memory space if applicable.

## ORA-06501: PL/SQL: program error

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5840

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An internal error occurred. An error was detected in the PL program.

* Solution: This is an internal error code. Contact OceanBase Technical Support for troubleshooting.

## ORA-06502: PL/SQL: numeric or value error: %.\*s

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5677

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An arithmetic, numeric, string, conversion, or constraint error occurred. For example, if you attempt to assign the `NULL` value to a variable that declares a `NOT NULL` constraint, or assign a value greater than `99` to a variable that declares `NUMBER(2)`, this error is reported.

* Solution: Modify the data, the data calculation method, or the data declaration method so that the value does not violate the constraint.

<!-- Cases:

* [Compatibility issues caused by the max_string_size parameter in Oracle mode](https://www.oceanbase.com/knowledge-base/oceanbase-database-1000000000209987) -->

## ORA-06504: PL/SQL: Return types of Result Set variables or query do not match

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5841

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The number or type of columns in the query does not match the return types declared by result set variables, or the types declared by two result set variables do not match.

* Solution: Modify the program statement or declaration. Identify the query referenced by variables during execution.

## ORA-06508: PL/SQL: could not find program unit being called: '%.\*s'

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5933

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The program unit is not found.

## ORA-06513: PL/SQL: index for PL/SQL table out of range for host language array

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9750
* SQLSTATE: HY000
* Cause: When you use a PL/SQL table, the index values exceed the value range of the array.
* Solution: Make sure that the values of the index do not exceed the value range of the array.

## ORA-06519: active autonomous transaction detected and rolled back

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5796

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: All active autonomous transactions in an autonomous PL block must be completed (committed or rolled back) before they return from the block. If these transactions are not completed, the active autonomous transactions are implicitly rolled back, thereby inducing this error.

* Solution: Make sure that all active autonomous transactions are explicitly specified or rolled back before they return from the autonomous PL block.

## ORA-06530: Reference to uninitialized composite

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5837

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An object, large object, or another composite object (such as a nested table or a record) that is not initialized is referenced on the left side.

* Solution: Initialize the composite object by using a proper constructor or through global object assignment.

## ORA-06531: Reference to uninitialized collection

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5838

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A nested table, `VARRAY` element, or `Member` function is referenced, which requires an initialized collection, but the collection is not initialized.

* Solution: Initialize the collection by using an appropriate constructor or through global object assignment.

## ORA-06532: Subscript outside of limit

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5843

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The subscript exceeds the upper limit for a `VARRAY` array, or the subscript is a non-positive value of a `VARRAY` array or nested table.

* Solution: Check the program logic and increase the upper limit for a `VARRAY` array if necessary.

## ORA-06533: Subscript beyond count

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5828

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The subscript exceeds the maximum length of the `VARRAY` or is too large for the nested table.

* Solution: Check the logic of the program, and extend the logic explicitly if necessary.

## ORA-06535: statement string in EXECUTE IMMEDIATE is NULL or 0 length

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9711

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The program was attempting to use a dynamic statement string that was either NULL or 0 in length.

* Solution: Check the program logic and make sure that the dynamic statement string is properly initialized.

## ORA-06546: DDL statement is executed in an illegal context

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5981

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A DDL statement is executed dynamically in an illegal PL/SQL context:

   * Dynamic OPEN cursor for a DDL statement in PL/SQL.

   * The Bind variable is used in the USING clause to immediately execute a DDL statement.

   * The Define variable is used in the INTO clause to immediately execute a DDL statement.

* Solution: Use `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` without `USING` and `INTO` clauses to execute the DDL statement.

## ORA-06547: RETURNING clause must be used with INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9713

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: EXECUTE IMMEDIATE with a RETURNING clause is used to execute only dynamic UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE statements.

* Solution: Use the RETURNING clause in EXECUTE IMMEDIATE only for executing INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements. For other statements, use the USING clause instead.

## ORA-06548: no more rows needed

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5839

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The caller of the pipelined function does not require the pipelined function to generate more rows.

* Solution: Do not handle the `NO_DATA_NEEDED` exception in an exception handling block.

## ORA-06553: wrong number or types of arguments in call to '%.\*s'

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5343

* SQLSTATE: 42000

* Cause: SQL statement compilation failed due to the invalid reference of a PL unit.

* Solution: If the PLS error message does not provide a solution, try to execute the SQL statement as a top-level call.

## ORA-06562: type of out argument must match type of column or bind variable

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9568

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `LONG` type is specified for the `column_value_long` and `define_value_long` functions, which is not allowed.

* Solution: Specify supported argument types for the `column_value_long` and `define_value_long` functions.

## ORA-06563: name has too many parts

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9714

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause:

   The name to be resolved was specified as one of the following forms:

   * A.B.C: The A.B part was resolved to a valid object that did not expose any visible nested procedures, and therefore the C part could not be resolved.

   * A.B: The A part was resolved to a valid object that did not expose any visible nested procedures, and therefore the B part could not be resolved.

* Solution: Specify the valid name of an object without specifying any additional trailing parts.

</main>

## ORA-08004: sequence exceeds %s and cannot be instantiated

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4332

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: Instantiating `Nextval` would violate either `MAXVALUE` or `MINVALUE`.

* Solution: Change the sequence so that new values can be requested.

## ORA-08006: specified row no longer exists

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 38105

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: Other users have deleted this row since the operation begins.

* Solution: Retry this operation.

## ORA-08102: index key not found
