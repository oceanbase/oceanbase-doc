    <h4>Applicability</h4>
    <p>This topic applies to only OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition. OceanBase Database Community Edition provides only the MySQL mode. </p>
  </main>

PLS-00001: PL/SQL common error", "%s
--------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9656

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An unexpected symbol appears.

* Solution: Change the unexpected symbol that appears in the position with the error.

PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol %s when expecting one of the following: %s
--------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9700

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The parser found a token (language element) that is inappropriate in this context.

* Solution: Check the previous tokens as well as the one given in the error message. The line and column numbers given in the error message refer to the end of the faulty language construct.

PLS-00109: unknown exception name '%.\*s' in PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9583

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The declaration of the exception name referenced in the `EXCEPTION_INIT` pragma is not found in the scope of pragmas.

* Solution: Make sure that the pragmas comply with the exception declaration and are within the same scope.

PLS-00113: END identifier '%.\*s' must match '%.\*s
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9659

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The keyword `END` terminates some language constructs (such as loops, blocks, functions, and procedures). Following this keyword, you can optionally place the name of such a construct. For example, at the end of the definition of loop `L`, you might write `END L`. This error occurs when the optional name does not match the name given to the language construct. It is usually caused by a misspelled identifier or by faulty block structure.

* Solution: Make sure that the spelling of the END identifier matches the name given to the language construct and that the block structure is correct.

PLS-00114: identifier ' %.\*s' too long
-----------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9526

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The name of the PL variable exceeds 128 characters. The maximum length of a valid identifier (including the quotation marks) is 128 characters. A string may be incorrectly enclosed by double quotation marks instead of single quotation marks, and PL considers it an identifier with quotation marks.

* Solution: Shorten the identifier.

PLS-00115: this PRAGMA must follow the declaration of '%.\*s
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9622

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `pragma` refers to a PL/SQL object that was not declared or is not within the scope of the reference. Identifiers must be declared before they are used in a pragma. Forward references are not allowed.

* Solution: Check the spelling and declaration of the identifier. In addition, confirm that the declaration is placed correctly in the block structure.

PLS-00119: Duplicate having-clause in table expression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9501

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `SELECT` statement contains two or more `HAVING` clauses.

* Solution: Delete one `HAVING` clause, and use `AND` or `OR` to connect logical expressions when necessary.

PLS-00124: name of exception expected for first arg in exception_init pragma
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9674

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The first argument passed to the `EXCEPTION_INIT` pragma was not an exception name.

* Solution: Replace the first argument with the name of a legally declared exception.

PLS-00128: Illegal number of arguments for pragma EXCEPTION_INIT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9675

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The number of arguments (actual parameters) passed to the named `pragma` (compiler directive) is incorrect. A required argument was omitted from the argument list, or the pragma syntax contains errors. For example, a comma might be missing between two parameters.

* Solution: Specify the missing argument or correct the faulty syntax.

PLS-00130: Pragma %s expects 1st argument to be a procedure/function/package/cursor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9661

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The first argument (actual parameter) passed to the named `pragma` (compiler directive) was not the name of a subprogram, package, or cursor, as required. The parameter might be misspelled, or the pragma syntax might contain errors. For example, a comma might be missing between two parameters.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the first argument, and make sure that the proper syntax is used.

PLS-00132: Pragma %s does not support %.\*s
---------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9658

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: One of the parameters passed to this `pragma` was not among the list of allowed values. The parameter might be misspelled, or the pragma syntax might contain errors. For example, a comma might be missing between two parameters.

* Solution: Check the spelling of all parameters, and make sure that the proper syntax is used.

PLS-00154: An object type may have only 1 MAP or 1 ORDER method
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9523

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: Multiple `MAP` or `ORDER` functions were declared. One object type can have only one `MAP` or `ORDER` function.

PLS-00155: Only a function may be a MAP, ORDER or CONSTRUCTOR method
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9525

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A procedure is declared as the `MAP`, `ORDER`, or `CONSTRUCTOR` method. Only functions can be declared as the `MAP`, `ORDER`, or `CONSTRUCTOR` method.

PLS-00157: Only schema-level programs allow %s
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9506

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `AUTHID` or `DEFAULT COLLATION` clause is specified for a program package or type. Only mode-level stored procedures, program packages, and types support these clauses.

* Solution: Delete the clause.

PLS-00168: string'", "duplicate modifier specification '%s'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9643

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A method or object type modifier was specified repeatedly.

* Solution: Retain only one modifier and remove all other duplicate ones.

</main>

PLS-00169: modifier '%s' conflicts with prior '%s' specification
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9642

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The method or object type modifier specified conflicts with an earlier modifier. For example, a FINAL modifier cannot be combined with a NOT FINAL modifier.

* Solution: Remove one of the conflicting modifiers.

PLS-00172: string literal too long
------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9644

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The string literal was longer than 32,767 bytes.

* Solution: Use a string literal of at most 32,767 bytes.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00179: $ERROR: %.\*s
--------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9540

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `$ERROR` directive is used.

PLS-00182: Identifier cannot be an empty string
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9657

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The identifier was declared using an empty string.

* Solution: Rename the identifier to a non-empty string.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00201: identifier '%.\*s' must be declared
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error codes in OceanBase Database: 5543 and 5546

* SQLSTATE: 42000

* Cause:

   * An undeclared variable, exception, or procedure was referenced.

   * An item to which no privilege was granted was referenced.

   * An item to which privileges were granted only through a role was referenced.

   * A stored object, such as a program package, procedure, function, trigger, or view, runs in the security zone of the object owner, and no other roles except `PUBLIC` are enabled.

* Solution:

   * Check the spelling and declaration of the referenced item name.

   * Check whether the declaration of the referenced item is correctly placed in the block structure.

   * If you are sure that the referenced item is declared and you are authorized to reference this item, check your privileges.

PLS-00204: function or pseudo-column '%s' may be used inside a SQL statement only
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9682

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A pseudo column or a proscribed function is used in the procedural statement. SQL pseudo columns such as LEVEL, ROWID, and ROWNUM can be used only in SQL statements. Similarly, some functions (such as DECODE, DUMP, and VSIZE) and SQL group functions (AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, COUNT, SUM, STDEV, and VARIANCE) can be used only in SQL statements.

* Solution: Delete the pseudo column reference or function call statement from the procedural statement, or replace the procedural statement with the SELECT INTO statement. For example, replace `bonus := DECODE(rating, 1, 5000, 2, 2500, ...);` with `SELECT DECODE(rating, 1, 5000, 2, 2500, ...) INTO bonus FROM dual;`.

PLS-00206: %%TYPE must be applied to a variable, column, field or attribute, not to '%.\*s'
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9547

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The program object declared by using the `%TYPE` data type attribute is not of the appropriate class. The data type must be variable, column, record group, subprogram parameter, or another object that supports value assignment.

* Solution: Add an initialization clause to the variable declaration. If the syntax of the initialization clause is complex, you can add a function call in place of the syntax.

PLS-00218: a variable declared NOT NULL must have an initialization assignment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9514

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: In a declaration, a variable without an initialization clause is automatically initialized into `NULL`, which is illogical for a `NOT NULL` variable. Therefore, an initialization clause is needed.

* Solution: Add an initialization clause to the variable declaration. If the syntax of the initialization clause is complex, you can add a function call in place of the syntax.

PLS-00221: %s' is not a procedure or is undefined
---------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9683

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An identifier being referenced as a procedure was not declared or actually represents another object. For example, it might have been declared as a function.

* Solution: Check the spelling and declaration of the identifier. In addition, confirm that the declaration is placed correctly in the block structure.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00222: no function with name '%.\*s' exists in this scope
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9627

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An identifier being referenced as a function was not declared or actually represents another object. For example, it might have been declared as a procedure.

* Solution: Check the spelling and declaration of the identifier. In addition, confirm that the declaration is placed correctly in the block structure.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00225: subprogram or cursor '%.\*s' reference is out of scope
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9628

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The prefix in a qualified name was a subprogram or cursor beyond an enclosing scope. That is, a subprogram or cursor name is being used as a scope qualifier for a reference to an entity (within that subprogram or cursor) that is not in scope. Example: `declare x number; type t1 is record (a number); function f return t1 is a number; begin x := f.a;`:

   * Legal use of function "f" as a scope qualifier

      * Resolves to local variable "a" in function `x := f().a;`

      * Legal reference to component "a" of the returned record end

   * Illegal use of function "f" as a scope qualifier `x := f().a;` and legal reference to component "a" of the returned record end

* Solution:

   * If you intend to refer to a local variable of a non-enclosing function, this is not allowed. You must remove the reference.

   * If this is a parameterless function, and you intend to access a field of the function call result, use empty parentheses in the call.

PLS-00227: subprogram 'in' formal %.\*s is not yet denotable
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9598

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: When the formal parameters of a subprogram were declared, one parameter was used to initialize another. Example: `PROCEDURE my_proc (j NUMBER, k NUMBER := j) IS ...`. The first parameter has no value until runtime. Therefore, it cannot be used to initialize another parameter.

* Solution: Remove the illegal formal parameter reference.

  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00230: OUT and IN OUT formal parameters may not have default expressions
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9599

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: When the formal parameters of a procedure were declared, an `OUT` or `IN-OUT` parameter was initialized to a default value. Example: `PROCEDURE calc_bonus (bonus OUT REAL := 0, ...) IS ...`. However, only the `IN` parameter can be initialized to the default value.

* Solution: Remove the illegal default expression.

</main>

PLS-00231: function '%.\*s' may not be used in SQL
----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9668

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A prohibited function was used in an SQL statement. Certain functions such as `SQLCODE` and `SQLERRM` can be used only in procedural statements.

* Solution: Remove the call to the function from the SQL statement. Alternatively, use a local variable to replace the function call. For example, the following statement is illegal: `INSERT INTO errors VALUES (SQLCODE, SQLERRM);`. However, you can assign the values of `SQLCODE` and `SQLERRM` to local variables and then use the variables in the SQL statement, as in `err_num := SQLCODE; err_msg := SQLERRM; INSERT INTO errors VALUES (err_num, err_msg);`.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00254: OUT and IN/OUT modes cannot be used in this context
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9502

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The actual parameter mode (`OUT` or `IN/OUT`) is not properly used in the `USING` clause. For the `USING` clause in the `OPEN` statement, only the `IN` mode is allowed.

* Solution: Change the parameter mode in the `USING` clause to the correct mode.

PLS-00263: mismatch between string on a subprogram specification and body
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9602

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An `ACCESSIBLE BY` clause was specified in a package body for an item with no equivalent clause in the package specification. In a package body, this clause can only be specified on externally visible subprograms, and the subprogram specification and body must have equivalent clauses. You cannot specify this clause on package-local or nested subprograms.

* Solution: Modify the clause on the subprogram body for compliance with the specification errors until 300 PH2 errors are reserved for external procedures.

PLS-00301: Invalid GOTO to non-label '%.\*s'
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9667

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A `GOTO` statement was converted into something which is not a label (such as a variable).

* Solution: Specify a valid label name.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00302: component '%.\*s' must be declared
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9681

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A referenced component (for example, in the name "a.B", "B" is a component of "a") has not been declared. The error might be caused by component misspelling, incorrect declaration, or incorrect declaration position in the block structure.

* Solution: Check the spelling and declaration of the component. In addition, confirm that the declaration is placed correctly in the block structure.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00304: cannot compile body of '%.\*s' without its specification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9520

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The program package specification required for compiling the body of the program package cannot be found. The possible causes are as follows:

   * The name of the software package is misspelled.

   * The software package specification is never compiled.

   * The compiled software package specification cannot be accessed. The software package specification must be compiled before the body of the software package is compiled, and the compiler must have the privilege to access the compiled specification.

* Solution:

   * Check the spelling of the software package name.

   * Compile the program package specification before you compile the body of the program package.

   * Make sure that the compiler can access the compiled specification.

PLS-00305: previous use of '%.\*s' conflicts with this use
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9529

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: When the compiler searches for the predeclaration of a cursor, procedure, function, or program package, it finds another object with the same name in the same action scope, or the name in the header of the subprogram does not match the name in the body.

* Solution:

   1. Check the spelling of the cursor, procedure, function, or program package name.

   2. Check the names of all constants, variables, parameters, and exceptions declared in the same action scope.

   3. Delete or rename objects with duplicate names.

   4. Modify the name in the header of the subprogram so that it matches the name in the body of the program.

PLS-00306: wrong number or types of arguments in call to '%.\*s'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9542

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A subprogram call does not match any declaration of the subprogram name. The possible causes are as follows:

   * The subprogram name is misspelled.

   * The data type of a parameter is incorrect.

   * The declaration is incorrect or is incorrectly placed in a block structure. For example, the built-in square root function `SQRT` is called by using a misspelled name or a parameter with an invalid data type.

* Solution:

   * Check the spelling and declaration of the subprogram name.

   * Make sure that the subprogram call is correct.

   * Make sure that the parameters are of correct data types.

   * Make sure that the declaration is correctly placed in a block structure if the function is not a built-in function.

PLS-00307: too many declarations of '%.\*s' match this call
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9544

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The declaration of a subprogram or cursor name is ambiguous. This is because the declaration and call do not exactly match and multiple declarations match the call during the implicit conversion of parameter data types. The possible causes are as follows:

   * The subprogram or cursor name is misspelled.

   * The declaration is incorrect.

   * The declaration is not correctly placed in a block structure.

* Solution:

   * Check the spelling and declaration of the subprogram or cursor name.

   * Make sure that the call is correct.

   * Make sure that the parameters are of correct data types.

   * Place the declaration properly in a block structure if the function is not a built-in function.

PLS-00310: with %%ROWTYPE attribute, '%.\*s' must name a table, cursor or cursor-variable
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9586

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `%ROWTYPE` attribute must be applied to an identifier declared as a cursor, cursor variable, or database table. This error occurs when `%ROWTYPE` follows an identifier that has not been declared.

* Solution: Change the declaration or do not apply the `%ROWTYPE` attribute to the identifier.

PLS-00312: a positional parameter association may not follow a named association
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9653

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: When a parameter list is passed to a subprogram or cursor, if both positional and named associations are used, all positional associations must be placed in their declared order and before all named associations, which can be in any order.

* Solution: Reorder parameters in the list to meet the requirements or use named associations only.

PLS-00315: Implementation restriction: unsupported table index type
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9610

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A data type other than BINARY_INTEGER, PLS_INTEGER, or VARCHAR2 was specified in the `INDEX BY` clause of a PL/SQL table declaration. A PL/SQL table can have one column and a primary key. The column can be of any scalar type, but the primary key must be of either the BINARY_INTEGER or VARCHAR2 type.

* Solution: Use a supported key type in the `INDEX BY` clause.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This error code is introduced since OceanBase Database V4.0.0. </p>
</main>

PLS-00316: PL/SQL TABLEs must use a single index
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9631

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A composite primary key was specified in the `INDEX BY` clause of a PL/SQL table declaration. A PL/SQL table must have a simple, unnamed primary key of the BINARY_INTEGER or VARCHAR2 type.

* Solution: Use a supported key type in the `INDEX BY` clause.

PLS-00318: type '%.\*s' is malformed because it is a non-REF mutually recursive type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9539

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The type declaration is in incorrect format because the declaration contains a mutually recursive non-reference relationship. The possible causes are as follows:

   * A recursive self-reference is included.

   * A mutually recursive reference is included.

* Solution: Use another type in the declaration to avoid recursion.

PLS-00320: the declaration of the type of this expression is incomplete or malformed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9597

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A variable or cursor name in the declaration is misspelled, or the declaration contains a forward reference. Forward references are not allowed in PL/SQL. A variable or cursor must be declared before it is referenced in other statements, including other declarative statements. For example, a declaration of `dept_rec` causes this exception because it references an undeclared cursor `dept_cur`. Here is an example:

   ```unknow
   DECLARE dept_rec dept_cur%ROWTYPE;
   CURSOR dept_cur IS SELECT ...
   ```

* Solution: Check the spelling of all identifiers in the declaration. Change the position of the declaration to eliminate forward references if necessary.

PLS-00321: expression '%.\*s' is inappropriate as the left hand side of anassignment statement
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9513

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: This expression appears on the left side of an assignment statement, which is not allowed. For example, `SYSDATE: = '01 -JAN-1990';` is not allowed because the function `SYSDATE` cannot appear on the left side of the assignment statement.

* Solution: Modify the assignment statement.

PLS-00322: declaration of a constant '%.\*s' must contain an initialization assignment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9515

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The constant declaration does not contain an initial value.

* Solution: Modify the constant declaration.

PLS-00323: subprogram or cursor '%.\*s' is declared in a package specification and must be defined in the package body
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9585

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A cursor or subprogram declared in the package header is not defined in the package body.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the subprogram name. Add the missing subprogram body to the package body if necessary.

PLS-00325: non-integral numeric literal %.\*s is inappropriate in this context
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9605 and 9670

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A non-integral numeric literal is used in a context that requires an integer.

* Solution: Replace the inappropriate literal with an integral literal.

PLS-00328: A subprogram body must be defined for the forward declaration of %.\*s
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9587

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A subprogram specification was declared, but the corresponding subprogram body was not defined. The subprogram specification and body should be written as one unit, or the specification should be separated from its body, which is necessary when you want to define mutually recursive subprograms or to group subprograms in a package.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the subprogram name. Provide the missing subprogram body if necessary.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9609

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: You are attempting to make a reference from a schema-level type to something other than a schema-level type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9680

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A reference to a database table, view, or sequence was found in an inappropriate context. Such references can appear only in SQL statements or (excluding sequences) in the declarations of `%TYPE` and `%ROWTYPE`. Here are some valid examples: `SELECT ename, emp.deptno, dname INTO my_ename, my_deptno, my_dept .FROM emp, dept WHERE emp.deptno = dept.deptno; DECLARE last_name emp.ename %TYPE; dept_rec dept%ROWTYPE;`

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: Either a body (`SELECT` statement) or a return type is missing in a cursor declaration. If you want to separate a cursor specification from its body, you must provide a return type, as in `CURSOR c1 RETURN emp%ROWTYPE;`.

* Solution: Add a `SELECT` statement or return type to the cursor declaration.

PLS-00362: invalid cursor return type; '%.\*s' must be a record type
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9593

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: In a cursor specification or the definition of a REF CURSOR type, a non-record type such as NUMBER or TABLE was specified as the return type. This is not allowed. Only return types in the following code are allowed: `<record_type_name><record_name>%type<table_name>%ROWTYPE<cursor_name>%ROWTYPE<cursor_variable_name>%ROWTYTPE`

* Solution: Revise the cursor specification or the definition of the REF CURSOR type to specify one of the above return types.

PLS-00363: expression '%.\*s' cannot be used as an assignment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9550

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A literal, constant, `IN` parameter, `counter` variable in LOOP, or function call is incorrectly used in the statement.

* Solution: Modify the statement expression.

PLS-00366: subtype of a not null type must also be not null
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9684

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A subtype defined as `NOT NULL` is used as the base type for another subtype defined as `NULL`. Example: `DECLARE SUBTYPE Weekday IS INTEGER NOT NULL; SUBTYPE Weekend IS Weekday;`.

* Solution: Modify the subtype definition.

PLS-00367: a RAISE statement with no exception name must be inside an exception handler
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9592

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9596

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A construct in the `WHEN excep1 OR OTHERS` form was detected in the definition of an exception handler. The `OTHERS` handler must appear by itself as the last exception handler in a block.

* Solution: Remove any identifier that appears with `OTHERS` or write a separate exception handler for that identifier.

PLS-00370: OTHERS handler must be last among the exception handlers of a block
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9591

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: One or more exception handlers are placed after an OTHERS handler. However, the `OTHERS` handler must be the last handler in a block or subprogram because it acts as the handler for all exceptions not named specifically.

* Solution: Move the `OTHERS` handler so that it follows all specific exception handlers.

PLS-00371: at most one declaration for '%.\*s' is permitted
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9507

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The reference of a variable is ambiguous because this variable has multiple declarations. In the declaration part of a block, procedure, or function, only one local variable with a given identifier is allowed. The given variable can appear only in one block.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the variable. Retain only one declaration of the variable and delete all other declarations if necessary.

PLS-00372: In a procedure, RETURN statement cannot contain an expression
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5583

* SQLSTATE: 42000

* Cause: In a procedure, the `RETURN` statement contains an expression, which is not allowed.

* Solution: Delete the expression from the `RETURN` statement, or redefine the procedure as a function.

PLS-00373: EXIT/CONTINUE label '%.\*s' must label a LOOP statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9512

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The label in the `EXIT` or `CONTINUE` statement does not reference the `LOOP` statement. No label needs to be specified for the `EXIT` or `CONTINUE` statement. If a label (such as a label in `EXIT my_label` or `CONTINUE my_label`) is specified, the label must reference the `LOOP` statement.

* Solution: Make sure that the label name is correctly spelled and the label references the `LOOP` statement.

PLS-00375: illegal GOTO statement; this GOTO cannot branch to label '%.\*s'
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9505

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The branch of the `GOTO` statement is a label from the outside of a construct (such as a loop or an exception handling program) that contains a statement sequence to the inside of the statement sequence. Such a branch is not allowed.

* Solution: Move the `GOTO` statement to the inside of the statement sequence, or move the labeled statement outside of the statement sequence.

PLS-00376: illegal EXIT/CONTINUE statement; it must appear inside a loop
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9510

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `EXIT` or `CONTINUE` statement is found outside of a loop construct. The `EXIT` statement exits from the loop prematurely, and the `CONTINUE` statement is used to start the next iteration of the loop. The two statements must always appear in a loop.

* Solution: Delete the `EXIT` or `CONTINUE` statement, or put them in a loop construct.

PLS-00382: expression is of wrong type
----------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9519

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The expression has a wrong data type.

* Solution: Change the data type of the expression. You may need to use the data type conversion feature.

PLS-00386: type mismatch found at '%.\*s' between FETCH cursor and INTO variables
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9590

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: An assignment target in the `INTO` list of a `FETCH` statement does not match in terms of data type with the corresponding column in the select list of the cursor declaration, and it is unclear which implicit conversion is required to correct the mismatch.

* Solution: Modify the cursor declaration or change the data type of the assignment target. You might want to use data type conversion functions in the select list of the query associated with the cursor.

PLS-00403: expression '%.\*s' cannot be used as an INTO-target of a SELECT/FETCH statement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9665

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `FETCH` statement cannot assign a value to an assignment target in its `INTO` list because the target is not a variable that is legally formed and declared. For example, the `FETCH my_cur INTO 'Jones'` assignment statement is invalid because `'Jones'` is a string rather than a variable.

* Solution: Check the spelling and declaration of the assignment target. Make sure that the variable naming rules are followed.

PLS-00404: cursor '%.*s' must be declared with FOR UPDATE to use with CURRENT OF
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9693

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: `cursor_name` in the `CURRENT OF cursor_name` clause was not declared in a `FOR UPDATE` clause.

* Solution: Add a `FOR UPDATE` clause to the definition of the cursor or do not use the `CURRENT OF cursor_name` clause.

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9508

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: When a user-defined record is declared, two fields with the same name are found. Like the column names in database tables, the user-defined field names must also be unique.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the field names and delete duplicate ones.

PLS-00413: identifier in CURRENT OF clause is not a cursor name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9692

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The identifier in a `CURRENT OF` clause names an object not a cursor.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the identifier. Make sure that the identifier names the cursor in the `DELETE` or `UPDATE` statement and that it names the cursor itself, not a FOR-loop variable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9614

PLS-00438: value in LIMIT clause \\'%.\*s\\' use is invalid
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9518

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The numeric value type of the `LIMIT` clause behind `FETCH INTO` is incorrect. For example, the following statement is invalid because the `LIMIT` clause requires a numeric value: `FETCH c1 BULK COLLECT INTO var_tab LIMIT 'aaaaa';`

* Solution: Modify the expression of the `LIMIT` clause so that it is followed by a numeric value. Example: `FETCH c1 BULK COLLECT INTO
   var_tab LIMIT '22333';`.

PLS-00439: A LIMIT clause must be used within a BULK FETCH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9636

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9654

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The specified name was not a label. An `EXIT` or `CONTINUE` statement does not require a label. However, when the optional name appears, it must be a label.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the name. Make sure that the name is the label of a loop nested with the `EXIT` or `CONTINUE` statement. If this statement does not need a label, delete the name.

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9619

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: You cannot call a packaged function from SQL statements unless its purity level is asserted by coding a `RESTRICT_REFERENCES` pragma in the package specification. The pragma is used to control side effects. It tells the PL/SQL compiler to deny the packaged function read/write access to database tables, public packaged variables, or both. An SQL statement that violates the pragma will cause a compilation error.

* Solution: Raise the purity level of the function, or ease restrictions on the pragma.

PLS-00485: in exception handler, '%.\*s' must be an exception name
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5545

* SQLSTATE: 42000

* Cause: An identifier not declared as an exception appeared in the `WHEN` clause of an exception handler. Only an exception name is valid in a `WHEN` clause.

* Solution: Check the spelling of the exception name to ensure that the exception was correctly declared.

PLS-00488: '%.\*s' must be a type
-----------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9543

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The data type descriptor in the declaration or expression does not designate a valid type. The possible causes are as follows:

   * The `％TYPE` attribute is not added to the declaration. For example, in `DECLARE my_sal emp.sal％TYPE;my_ename emp.ename;`, the `％TYPE` attribute is not declared.

   * To automatically provide the data type of a column when a constant or a variable is declared, the `％TYPE` attribute can be used.

   * To automatically provide the data type of a row when a record is declared, the `％ROWTYPE` attribute can be used.

* Solution: Make sure that the data type descriptor designates a valid type. Use the `％TYPE` and `％ROWTYPE` attributes if necessary.

PLS-00491: numeric literal required
-------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9604

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A constant or variable was used where a numeric literal was required. For example, the code might look like `my_ename VARCHAR2(max_len); instead of my_ename VARCHAR2(15);`. When you specify the maximum length of a VARCHAR2 variable, you must use an integer literal.

* Solution: Replace the identifier with a numeric literal.

PLS-00492: variable or constant initialization may not refer to functions declared in the same package
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9655

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: If a package `spec p` declares a function `f`, the function may not be used in any variable declarations in the same package specification. This error is caused by a circular instantiation problem: In order to fully instantiate the package specification, the variable must be initialized. To initialize the variable, the function body code in the package body must be executed. This requires that the package body is instantiated. However, the package body cannot be instantiated until the package specification is fully instantiated.

* Solution: Remove the reference to the function from the variable initialization. A method that is often used is to move the variable initialization from the variable declaration (in the package specification) to the package body initialization block.

PLS-00497: cannot mix between single row and multi-row (BULK) in INTO list
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9639

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause:

   * When a `BULK` syntax (such as `BULK COLLECT INTO`) is used to retrieve data, every variable in the `INTO` list must be of a type that is a collection of the type of the corresponding column.

   * When `BULK` is not used, every variable in the `INTO` list must be of a type compatible with the corresponding column.

* Solution: Change the `INTO` list to make sure that all variables have correct data types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9634

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A RETURN statement that contains no expression was used in a function body. In procedures, a `RETURN` statement contains no expression because the statement just returns control to the caller. However, in functions, a `RETURN` statement must contain an expression because its value is assigned to the function identifier.

* Solution: Add an expression to the `RETURN` statement.

PLS-00520: MAP methods must be declared without any parameters other than (optional) SELF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9532

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: Parameters are declared for the `MAP` member function. The `MAP` member function can have only one parameter, which is the default `SELF` parameter. The `MAP` function cannot be declared as any parameter, and the `SELF` parameter is added by the compiler.

* Solution: Delete the parameters from the `MAP` function.

PLS-00521: ORDER methods must be declared with 1 (one) parameter in addition to (optional) SELF
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9538

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `ORDER` function is declared without user-defined parameters. The `ORDER` function has two parameters, one of which is the default `SELF` parameter added by the compiler. The other parameter is added by the user and must be of the same type as the contained object.

* Solution: Change the parameter type.

PLS-00522: MAP methods must return a scalar type
--------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9531

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `MAP` member function is compiled in a way that it returns a value not of the scalar type.

* Solution: Recompile the `MAP` function so that it returns a value of the scalar type.

PLS-00523: ORDER methods must return an INTEGER
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9533

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `ORDER` function returns a value not of the integer type.

* Solution: Recompile the `ORDER` function so that it returns a value of the integer type.

PLS-00524: The parameter type in an ORDER method must be the containing object type
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9534

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `ORDER` function is declared without user-defined parameters. The `ORDER` function has two parameters, one of which is the default `SELF` parameter added by the compiler. The other parameter is added by the user and must be of the same type as the contained object.

* Solution: Change the parameter type.

PLS-00525: Within SQL statements, only equality comparisons of objects are allowed without a map or order function
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9535

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The `MAP` or `ORDER` function is not provided for comparison. In this case, only equality comparison can be used.

* Solution: Provide the `MAP` or `ORDER` function, or enable the program to use only equality comparison.

PLS-00526: A MAP or ORDER function is required for comparing objects in PL/SQL
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9524

* Cause:

   * `pragma restrict_references` is not specified.

   * `pragma restrict_references` is specified but lacks any of the following parameters: `WNDS`, `WNPS`, `RNPS`, or `RNDS`.

* Solution: Add or correct `pragma`, and then retry.

PLS-00528: The parameters to an ORDER function must have IN mode

PLS-00572: improper constraint form used
------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9606

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: "number" types cannot have a range. You cannot specify the scale or precision for user-defined aggregate types or integer types. For example, `"x number(5,3)"` is acceptable but `"x number range 1..10"` is not.

* Solution: Remove the constraint.

PLS-00586: a static method cannot declare a parameter named SELF
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9649

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: You are attempting to name a parameter `SELF` when declaring a static method. `SELF` is reserved as a parameter name in a method to hold the object instance on which the method is applied. A parameter named `SELF` is not allowed in static methods because static methods do not apply to a particular object instance.

* Solution: Change the name of the parameter in the declaration.

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9589

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: A locally-defined (that is, not the schema level) collection type was used in an SQL statement. To be accepted in an SQL statement, the type must be defined in a schema.

* Solution: Define the collection type in your schema instead of in a PL/SQL subprogram.

PLS-00652: incorrect number of arguments for aggregate function

PLS-00701: illegal ORACLE error number %.\*s for PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9629

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The error code passed to the `EXCEPTION_INIT` pragma is out of range. The error code must be in the range of `1-9999` (excluding `100`) or in the range of `20000-20999` for user-defined errors.

* Solution: Use a valid error code.

PLS-00702: second argument to PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT must be a numeric literal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 9676

* SQLSTATE: HY000

* Cause: The second parameter passed to the `EXCEPTION_INIT` pragma is not a numeric literal (such as a variable). The second parameter must be a numeric literal in the range of `1-9999` (excluding `100`). Error codes in the range of `20000-20999` indicate user-defined errors.

* Solution: Replace the second parameter with a valid error code.
