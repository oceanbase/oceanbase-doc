This topic describes how to install SQL Diagnoser.

## Environment requirements

SQL Diagnoser must be installed in Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

## Prerequisites

The default port of SQL Diagnoser (8080) is not occupied. You can also customize a port.

## Procedure

2. Run the following command to install SQL Diagnoser:
   ```nohup java -jar /home/admin/sql-diagnoser-4.2.0.0.jar &```

   To specify a listening port, add `-Dserver.port` to the code. A sample command is as follows: `nohup java -Dserver.port=9090 -jar /home/admin/sql-diagnoser-4.2.0.0.jar &`.
