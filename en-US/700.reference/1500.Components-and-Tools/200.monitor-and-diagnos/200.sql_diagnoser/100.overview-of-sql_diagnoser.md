# Overview

This topic describes the concept and features of SQL Diagnoser.

## Concept

SQL Diagnoser is an agile SQL diagnostic tool that can directly analyze business clusters to find common suspicious SQL statements and hidden performance issues. It also supports SQL review. You can enter an SQL statement on the SQL review page for analysis.

## Features

SQL Diagnoser has the following features:

* In addition to the built-in diagnostic items, SQL Diagnoser allows you to define custom diagnostic items for diagnosing tenant SQL statements. You only need to understand simple SQL-like syntax to define diagnostic rules. For more information, see **Define diagnostic rules** in [Use SQL Diagnoser](200.deploy-and-use-delsql_diagnoser/200.sql_diagnoser-development-guide.md).

* The API documentation of SQL Diagnoser for diagnosing tenant SQL statements is available. You can implement custom diagnostics by using the API operations. For more information, see [API operations](300.sql_diagnoser-paramenters/300.sql_diagnoser-api.md).

* SQL review has some built-in diagnostic items. For more information, see [Diagnostic items of SQL review](300.sql_diagnoser-paramenters/400.sql_diagnoser-review-items.md).
