# Diagnostic items of SQL review

This topic describes the diagnostic items of the SQL review feature.

| Diagnostic item | Description |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too many partitions involved | During SQL execution, too many partitions are involved in the calculation, wasting system resources.  |
| Predicate calculus | The `WHERE` clause contains column calculation, and the index cannot take effect.  |
| Prefix fuzzy match | Prefix fuzzy match is specified by `like "%xxx"` or `like "%xxx%"`, and the index cannot take effect.  |
| Too many `in` conditions | Too many `in` conditions exist. We recommend that you use no more than 200 `in` conditions, for example, `in(?,?,?..)`.  |
| Too many table connections | Too many table connections exist. We recommend that you use no more than 10 table connections. Otherwise, no optimal plan is available after pruning.  |
| No `not null` constraint in the `not in` clause | The `not in` clause must contain the `not null` constraint to avoid `nested loop join`.  |
| Identically true WHERE condition | The `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement does not contain the `WHERE` condition, or the `WHERE` condition is identically true.  |
| Use of the `not in` clause | We recommend that you use the `not in` clause with caution. It involves special logic for processing null values, and the semantics are difficult to control.  |
| INSERT/REPLACE statement without fields | We recommend that you do not use the `INSERT` or `REPLACE` statement without fields.  |
| UPDATE/DELETE/SELECT statement without index key | The `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `SELECT` statement does not contain an index key, resulting in a full table scan.  |
| Operation on a partitioned table without a partitioning key | The operation on the partitioned table does not contain a partitioning key, and thus partitions cannot be pruned.  |
| Too many indexes | Too many indexes exist, which are redundant.  |
| Column data skew | Data skew occurs in the column specified in the `WHERE` clause.  |
| Global/Local keyword not specified | When you create an index, you must manually specify the `Global` or `Local` keyword. We recommend that you use a local index.  |
| Too many table fields | Too many table fields exist.  |
