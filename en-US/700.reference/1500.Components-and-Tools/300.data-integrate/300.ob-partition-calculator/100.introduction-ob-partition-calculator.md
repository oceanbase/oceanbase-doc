# Overview

## Background information

When you insert a large amount of data, you can insert the data in batches based on the partitions to which the data belongs. This improves the efficiency of data insertion.

The ob-partition-calculator component provides an API for calculating the partitions to which data records belong.

This topic describes the operating principle of the ob-partition-calculator component.

## Workflow

The following figure shows the workflow of the ob-partition-calculator component:

The ob-partition-calculator component queries the partition information of a table based on the connection information that you specified. It obtains the following partition information:

* Partitioning type and number of partitions

* Field types, field names, and number of fields of partitions

* Values and upper limits of LIST and RANGE partitions

* Addresses of leaders corresponding to the partitions

The ob-partition-calculator component builds a partitioning model based on the partition information, to calculate the partition values corresponding to the input data.

## Partitioning types

### MySQL mode

* KEY partitioning

* HASH partitioning

* LIST partitioning

* LIST COLUMNS partitioning

* RANGE partitioning

* RANGE COLUMNS partitioning

### Oracle mode

* HASH partitioning

* LIST partitioning

* RANGE partitioning

## Supported value types

The ob-partition-calculator component supports the calculation for types of fields that can be used as partitioning keys in OceanBase Database. For more information about the field types, see the following topics:
