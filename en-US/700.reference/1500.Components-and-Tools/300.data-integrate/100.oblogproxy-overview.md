# OBLogProxy

[OBLogProxy](https://github.com/oceanbase/oblogproxy) is the incremental log proxy service of [OceanBase Database](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase). It establishes connections with OceanBase Database to read incremental logs and provides downstream services with change data capture (CDC) capabilities.

## Features

OBLogProxy supports two modes: binlog mode and CDC mode.

## Binlog mode

The binlog mode of OBLogProxy is designed for compatibility with MySQL binlogs. It supports MySQL binlog incremental parsing tools and can synchronize OceanBase Database logs to these tools in real time.

## CDC mode

OBLogProxy in CDC mode subscribes to data changes in OceanBase Database and synchronizes these data changes to downstream services in real time for real-time or quasi-realtime data replication and synchronization.
