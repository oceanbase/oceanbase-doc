## What is ob-operator?

ob-operator is a tool built on the Kubernetes Operator framework for managing OceanBase clusters in Kubernetes. It provides a simple and reliable way to achieve containerized deployment of OceanBase clusters, simplifying the O&M of OceanBase Database. ob-operator defines various resources related to OceanBase Database and implements corresponding coordination logic, allowing you to manage OceanBase Database in a declarative manner, similar to how you manage native Kubernetes resources.

## Features

ob-operator has the following features:

* OceanBase cluster management

   You can manage OceanBase clusters by creating or modifying the custom resource definition (CRD) `obparameters.oceanbase.oceanbase.com`.

   ob-operator provides automatic fault recovery capabilities, which can automatically restore the cluster when a failure occurs and the majority are still available, ensuring the normal operation of the cluster.
