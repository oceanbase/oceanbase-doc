# Format of clogs

This topic describes the print format of clogs.

Generally, a clog file contains many types of logs. As the predominant log type, `OB_LOG_SUBMIT` indicates the logs committed by modules other than the clog module, including the clogs committed by a transaction module.

A clog consists of three parts: abstract, header, and content, as shown in the following format:

```text
$$$abstract |header |||   |||content
```

## Abstract

The abstract describes the information about a log record in a log file, as shown in the following example:

```text
file_id:*** offset:*** len:***  OB_LOG_SUBMIT
```

The following table describes the fields.

| Field | Description |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| `file_id` | The name of the clog file. |
| `offset` | The offset of the log record in the log file. |
| `len` | The length of the log record. |
| `OB_LOG_SUBMIT` | Indicates that the type of the clog file is `OB_LOG_SUBMIT`. |

## Header

The header describes the information about the log record itself, as shown in the following example:

```text
ObLogEntryHeader:{magic:***, version:***, type:***, partition_key:***, log_id:***, data_len:***, generation_timestamp:***, epoch_id:***, proposal_id:***, submit_timestamp:***, is_batch_committed:***, is_trans_log:***, data_checksum:***, active_memstore_version:***, header_checksum:***}
```

The following table describes some fields.

| Field | Description |
|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| `partition_key` | The identifier of the data partition corresponding to the log record.  |
| `log_id` | The identifier of the log record.  |
| `generation_timestamp_` | The point in time when the log record was generated, in the format of Unix timestamp.  |
| `epoch_id` | The identifier of the election period, in the format of Unix timestamp.  |
| `proposal_id` | A Paxos protocol-related variable.  |
| `is_trans_log` | Indicates whether the log record is a clog.  |

## Entity

The content describes the data contained in the log record, as shown in the following example:

```text
Trans: log_type:***, trans_inc:*** {[trans_log]}||| [mutator]
```

The following table describes some fields.

| Field | Description |
|---------------|-----------------------------|
| `log_type` | The type of the clog. |
| `trans_id` | The transaction identifier corresponding to the clog. |
| `[trans_log]` | The information about the clog. |
| `[mutator]` | The information about transaction modifications. This field is displayed for redo logs. |

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The size of a log record is limited in OceanBase Database. If a transaction involves many modifications, multiple redo log records may be generated. </p>
