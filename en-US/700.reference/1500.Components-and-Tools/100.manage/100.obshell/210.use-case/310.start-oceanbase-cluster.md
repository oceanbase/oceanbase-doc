# Start an OceanBase cluster

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Shell (OBShell) to start an OceanBase cluster with three replicas. The procedure varies with the management status of the OceanBase cluster:

- OceanBase cluster managed by OBShell

- OceanBase cluster not managed by OBShell

For more information about how to check whether an OceanBase cluster is managed by OBShell, see **Step 3** in [Take over an OceanBase cluster not deployed by OBShell](300.take-over-non-obshell-deployed-clusters.md).

## Deployment mode

In this topic, the following three machines are used:

| Role | Machine | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.1 | In OceanBase Database Zone 1 |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.2 | In OceanBase Database Zone 2 |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.3 | In OceanBase Database Zone 3 |

## OceanBase cluster managed by OBShell

### Prerequisites

All OBShell processes are running normally. For more information, see [Start or stop OBShell](100.start-stop-obshell.md).

### Scenario 1: Start all observer processes

Run the following command on any OBServer node to start all observer processes. For more information, see [obshell cluster start](../300.obshell-clients/200.cluster-commands.md).

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell cluster start -a
```

### Scenario 2: Start specified observer processes

Run the following command on any OBServer node to start the specified observer process. For more information, see [obshell cluster start](../300.obshell-clients/200.cluster-commands.md).

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell cluster start -s 10.10.10.1:2886,10.10.10.2:2886
```

### Scenario 3: Start the observer processes in specified zones

Run the following command on any OBServer node to start the observer processes in the specified zone. For more information, see [obshell cluster start](../300.obshell-clients/200.cluster-commands.md).

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell cluster start -z zone1,zone2
```

## OceanBase cluster not managed by OBShell

The cluster is not managed by OBShell and must be taken over by OBShell. During the takeover, all observer processes are started to restore the cluster. For more information, see [Take over an OceanBase cluster not deployed by OBShell](300.take-over-non-obshell-deployed-clusters.md).
