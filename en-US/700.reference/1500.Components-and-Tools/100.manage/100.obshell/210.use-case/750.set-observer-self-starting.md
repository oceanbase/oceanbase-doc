# Configure an OBServer node to start automatically on boot

This topic describes how to configure an OBServer node to start automatically on boot through **online settings** or **offline settings** depending on whether the OBServer node can access the Internet. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You must separately configure the automatic start settings for each OBServer node in an OceanBase cluster. </p>
</main>

## Scenarios

The configuration methods described in this topic are applicable only if the following requirements are met:

* An OceanBase cluster is deployed and not managed by OceanBase Shell (OBShell). 

* You are using OceanBase Database V4.2.1.4 or later. 

## Online settings

If an OBServer node can access Internet, you can log on to the OBServer node and run the following command: 

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ sudo bash -c "$(curl -s https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/download-center/opensource/obshell/service_installer.sh)"
```

## Offline settings

If an OBServer node cannot access the Internet, you can log on to the OBServer node and perform the following operations: 

1. Create a script file.

   In this example, the file is named `self_start.sh`. You can use a custom name as needed. 

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ vim self_start.sh
   ```

   The content of the script file is as follows:

   ```shell
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Prompt the user for input and retrieve it
   prompt_for_input() {
       local prompt_message="$1"
       local user_input
       read -p "$prompt_message" user_input
       echo "$user_input"
   }
   
   # Check if the homepath argument was provided via the command line
   expected_arg_name="homepath"
   if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
       arg_value="$1"
   else
       # No arguments provided, ask the user for the homepath
       arg_value=$(prompt_for_input "Please enter the $expected_arg_name: ")
   fi
   echo "Using $expected_arg_name: $arg_value"
   
   # Check for the existence of the 'obshell' file in the provided homepath
   homepath=$arg_value
   obshell="$homepath/bin/obshell"
   if [ ! -f "$obshell" ]; then
       echo -e "\033[31m[ERROR]\033[0m Sorry, [$obshell] does not exist."
       echo "You may need to upgrade the obcluster. Please consult the developers for assistance."
       exit 1
   else
       echo "[$obshell] has been found in the work directory."
   fi
   
   # Check if the oceanbase.service file exists
   system_dir="/etc/systemd/system"
   oceanbase=$system_dir/oceanbase.service
   # Check if the service file exists
   if [ -f "$oceanbase" ]; then
       echo -e "\033[33m[WARN]\033[0m oceanbase.service has beed installed."
       echo "Please use 'systemctl status oceanbase.service' to check it."
       exit 0
   else
       echo "Service file $oceanbase does not exist."
   fi
   
   # Retrieve the owner of the 'observer' process configuration files
   owner=$(stat -c '%U' $homepath/etc)
   echo "Owner of the observer configuration: $owner"
   
   # Construct and output the content for the systemd service unit file
   name=observer.service
   mkdir -p $homepath/tmp
   file=$homepath/tmp/$name
   echo "Creating the service unit file at $file..."
   # Write the service content to the file
   cat << EOF > ${file}
   [Unit]
   Description=observer
   After=network.target
   [Service]
   User=${owner}
   Type=forking
   KillSignal=SIGKILL
   ExecStartPre=${homepath}/bin/obshell admin stop
   ExecStart=${homepath}/bin/obshell admin start --takeover 0
   ExecStartPost=${homepath}/bin/obshell admin stop
   ExecStop=${homepath}/bin/obshell admin stop
   PIDFile=${homepath}/run/observer.pid
   Restart=no
   SuccessExitStatus=SIGKILL
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOF
   echo "The content of the Service unit file is:"
   sed 's/^/  /' "$file"
   
   # Deploy the unit configuration file to the system directory
   echo "Deploying the service unit file to the system directory"
   cp -f $file $system_dir/$name
   echo "Updating permissions for the service unit file..."
   chmod 644 $system_dir/$name
   echo "Reloading the systemd daemon to recognize the new service"
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl enable observer.service
   echo -e "\033[32m[SUCCEED]\033[0m observer.service has been installed."
   ```

2. Run the script file.

   In this example, `/home/admin/oceanbase` is the installation directory of the OceanBase cluster. Specify the actual directory when you run the script file. 

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo sh self_start.sh /home/admin/oceanbase
   ```
