# Take over an OceanBase cluster not deployed by OBShell

This topic describes how to use OceanBase Shell (OBShell) to take over an OceanBase cluster with three replicas deployed by OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP). OBShell can take over an OceanBase cluster in any state.

## Deployment mode

In this topic, the following three machines are used: 

| Role | Machine | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.1 | In OceanBase Database Zone 1 |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.2 | In OceanBase Database Zone 2 |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.3 | In OceanBase Database Zone 3 |

## Procedure

### Step 1: Set the environment variable for the tenant password

If the `root` user of the `sys` tenant in the OceanBase cluster has a password, run the following command on any OBServer node to obtain the tenant password for OBShell. For example, the IP address of the OBServer node to use is `10.10.10.1`.

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ export OB_ROOT_PASSWORD="pwd"
```

### Step 2: Take over the cluster

Run the following command on the OBServer node (`10.10.10.1`) to start OBShell for each OBServer node in the current OceanBase cluster and perform the takeover. OBShell is installed in the `/home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell` directory. For more information about the command, see [obshell cluster start](../300.obshell-clients/200.cluster-commands.md).

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell cluster start -a
```

### Step 3: Check whether the takeover is successful

Call the `/api/v1/ob/info` API operation on any OBServer node where OBShell is stored. In the returned `agent_info`, if the value of `identity` is `CLUSTER AGENT`, the current OceanBase cluster is taken over by OBShell. For more information, see [GetObInfo](../400.obshell-api-reference/1800.get-oceanbase-info.md).

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>OBShell verifies the security of requested API operations. Therefore, you must encrypt the request before you call an API operation. For more information, see <a href='../400.obshell-api-reference/200.api-hybrid-encryption.md'>Hybrid encryption for API operations</a>. You must also specify <code>${request_headers}</code> and <code>${request_body}</code> in the <code>curl</code> command. </p>
</main>

- Run the following command:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ curl -H 'X-OCS-Header:${request_headers}' -X GET http://10.10.10.1:2886/api/v1/ob/info
   ```

- Here is a sample result:

   ```shell
   {
       .......
           "agent_info": [
               {
                   "ip": "10.10.10.1",
                   "identity": "CLUSTER AGENT",
                   ...
               },
               {
                   "ip": "10.10.10.2",
                   "identity": "CLUSTER AGENT",
                   ...
               },
               {
                   "ip": "10.10.10.3",
                   "identity": "CLUSTER AGENT",
                   ...
               }
           ],
           ...
   }
   ```

  <p>If the OceanBase cluster is managed by OBShell, the takeover is successful. </p>
