# Start or stop OBShell

## Start OBShell

You can start OceanBase Shell (OBShell) by running the following command:

```shell
${home_path}/bin/obshell agent start [--ip] [-P] [--takeover]
```

Here is an example:

```obshell
[admin@test001 ~]$ /home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell agent start --ip 10.10.10.1 -P 2886
```

Here, `home_path` is the installation directory of OceanBase Database. By default, OBShell is installed in the `bin` directory under the installation directory of OceanBase Database.

The following table describes the options in the command.

| Option | Required? | Data type | Default value | Description |
|------------|----------|---------|---------|------|
| --ip | No | String | N/A | The IP address of OBShell. |
| -P/--port | No | Integer | 2886 | The port number of OBShell. |
| --takeover | No | Integer | 1 | Specifies whether to take over the OceanBase cluster. The value `0` indicates not to take over, and other values indicate to take over. The default value is `1`. |
