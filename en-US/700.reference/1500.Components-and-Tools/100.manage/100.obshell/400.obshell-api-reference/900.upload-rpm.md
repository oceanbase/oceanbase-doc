    "UpgradeDepYaml": "# Describes the upgrade dependencies of different OceanBase Database versions.\n# For more information, see release/ptw5y7.\n\n# For each officially released OceanBase Database version, a record with the following attributes is added to the .yaml file:\n#  * version: the source version or a transition version during the upgrade. The value is a version number in the A.B.C format. If the value is in the A.B.C-D format, the build number must be greater than or equal to D.\n#  * can_be_upgraded_to: the target versions that the current version can be *directly* upgraded to. The value is a list of versions that are determined through compatibility tests by the QA of OceanBase Database.\n#  * deprecated: indicates whether the current version has been deprecated. The default value is False. The value True indicates that the current version has been deprecated and \n# can serve as the source version or a transition version of the upgrade, but cannot be the target version of the upgrade. \n#  * require_from_binary: The default value is False. The value True indicates that if the current version acts as a transition version of the upgrade, you must run the upgrade script and upgrade the OBServer node to this version.\n#\n\n# The OceanBase Database upgrade module of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) reads this file. Given the source and target versions of the upgrade, the upgrade module automatically\n# determines the shortest upgrade path if the preceding requirements are met. Algorithm:\n# The upgrade module builds a diagram based on the following descriptions. Each version is represented by a node and the value of can_be_upgraded_to is represented by a\n# side. The upgrade module finds the shortest path between the source and target versions. Except the start node, other nodes in an upgrade path\n# must not represent a version that has been deprecated.
