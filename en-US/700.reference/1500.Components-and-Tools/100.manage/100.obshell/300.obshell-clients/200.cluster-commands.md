# Cluster commands of OBShell

This topic describes the cluster commands of OceanBase Shell (OBShell). You can use the cluster commands of OBShell to deploy and manage OceanBase clusters in a production environment.

You can specify the `-h` or `--help` option in a command to query its help information. When a task returns an error, you can specify the `-v` or `--verbose` option to query the execution details of the command.

## obshell cluster join

You can run this command to add the OBServer node where OBShell is stored to an OceanBase cluster before the OceanBase cluster is initialized.

```shell
${home_path}/bin/obshell cluster join -z -s [-d] [-r] [-p] [-P] [-o] [-l]

# example
/home/admin/oceanbase/bin/obshell cluster join -z zone1 -s 10.10.10.1
```

Here, `home_path` is the installation directory of OceanBase Database. By default, OBShell is installed in the `bin` directory under the installation directory of OceanBase Database.
