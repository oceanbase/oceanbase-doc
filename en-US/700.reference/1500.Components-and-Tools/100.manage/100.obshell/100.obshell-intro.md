# Overview

OceanBase Shell (OBShell) is an out-of-the-box command-line tool for O&M engineers and developers to manage local OceanBase clusters. It supports cluster O&M and provides O&M and management API operations based on OBServer nodes. This allows you to integrate different third-party ecosystem tools into OceanBase Database to manage a single OceanBase cluster, which reduces the difficulty in and costs of OceanBase cluster management.

OBShell does not require installation operations. After you install OceanBase Database Community Edition, you can find the OBShell executable file in the `bin` directory under the working directory on any OBServer node.
