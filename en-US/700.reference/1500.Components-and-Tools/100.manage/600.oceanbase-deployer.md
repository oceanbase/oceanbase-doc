OceanBase Deployer (OBD) is a tool for installing and deploying OceanBase clusters. OBD allows you to deploy an OceanBase cluster on the CLI or GUI and provides a standardized configuration process to simplify cluster deployment. For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database on the CLI in a production environment](../../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/500.deploy-OceanBase-database-of-multi-node-cluster.md) and [Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI of OBD](../../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md).

In CLI-based deployment, you can edit the configuration file to flexibly adjust the configurations. This deployment mode is not easy for new hands and is suitable for users who want to deeply understand OceanBase Database. In GUI-based deployment, you can easily deploy a cluster by following the wizard. This deployment mode is suitable for users who want to quickly experience OceanBase Database in a standard environment.

Besides cluster deployment, OBD also provides general O&M capabilities such as the package manager, stress test software, and cluster management to provide better user experience on OceanBase Database.
