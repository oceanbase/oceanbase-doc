# General test case writing commands

This topic describes the commands commonly used for writing test cases.

## error

Verifies expected failures. Some test cases are written to verify SQL statement execution failures. You can add `--error [error code]` before an SQL statement.

Here, `--error` can be followed by two types of values: error code or SQL state. If `--error` is followed by an SQL state, the SQL state must be prefixed with S.

Here is an example:

```bash
--error 65535
create table t1(pk createtime primary key, a int);

--error SHY000
select a from t1 union select * from t2;
```

## let

Assigns numeric or string values to variables.

Here is an example:

```bash
let $var_name = value
```

## inc/dec

`inc` specifies to `increase an integer by 1` and `dec` specifies to `decrease an integer by 1`. They are the only operations supported by mysqltest.

Here is an example:

```bash
inc $varname
dec $varname
```

## eval

Executes SQL statements with variables.

Here is an example:

```bash
eval insert intot1(i,c1,c256,dt,d) values(0,'1','$i','2012-10-10 12:00:00','2012-10-10');
```

## echo

Prints variables in the terminal. It is usually used to add comments to result files.

Here is an example:

```bash
echo $tableName;

--echo merge happens
alter system major freeze;
```

## while

Performs loop control.

Here is an example:

```bash
let $cnt=10000;
while($cnt)
{
    eval create table tt_$cnt (pk int primary key, c1 int);
    dec $cnt;
}

select pk,b from t1;
```

## disable_warnings/enable_warnings

Specifies whether to generate unfiltered warnings in the server. The default value is `enable_warnings`.

Here is an example:

```bash
--disable_warnings
```

## real_sleep/sleep

Specifies the sleep time.

Here is an example:

```bash
real_sleep 20;
```

## replace_column

Replaces the values of some columns in the result set. Some results change based on the execution time, such as `create_time` or `modify_time`. You can use this command to replace the value with a constant.

Here is an example:

```bash
--replace_column 2 searched

# You can replace multiple values at a time.
--replace_column 1 create_time 2modify_time 3 tenant_id 6 zone 8 zone 7 zone
```

## query_get_value(query,col_name,row_num)

Obtains the value in a specific row and column of the query result.

Here is an example:

```bash
let $idx1 =query_get_value(select a.table_name from oceanbase.__all_table as a innerjoin (select * from oceanbase.__all_table where table_name='t1') b ona.data_table_id=b.table_id, table_name, 1);
let $idx2 =query_get_value(select a.table_name from oceanbase.__all_table as a innerjoin (select * from oceanbase.__all_table where table_name='t1') b ona.data_table_id=b.table_id, table_name, 2);
```

## connect/disconnect/connection

Establishes or terminates a connection.

You may use the `connect` or `disconnect` command when you test sessions to establish or terminate a connection. The `connection` command specifies the connection for executing SQL statements. You can switch between connections. This command is usually used in concurrent transaction processing.

## disable_abort_on_error/enable_abort_on_error

If `abort_on_error` is enabled, after the execution of an SQL statement fails, mysqltest exits and does not execute the subsequent content or generate a reject file. If `abort_on_error` is disabled, after the execution of an SQL statement fails, mysqltest continues to execute the subsequent content and generates a reject file.

## disable_query_log/enable_query_log

If `query_log` is enabled, all SQL statements are recorded in the result file. In some cases, when many queries exist in a loop, you can use `disable_query_log`.

Here is an example:

```bash
--disable_query_log
let $cnt5=74;
while ($cnt5)
{
eval drop table  ttl$cnt5;
dec $cnt5;
}
--enable_query_log
```

## if(exptr){do sql}

If the value of `exptr` is not 0, mysqltest executes the content enclosed by braces.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>mysqltest does not provide the <code>else if</code> or <code>else</code> option. In earlier versions of mysqltest, the value of <code>exptr</code> cannot be a comparison expression. </p>
  </main>

Here is an example:

```bash
if($valuenow== $valueorig)
{
--echo succeed
}
```

## disable_result_log/enable_result_log

Specifies whether to write the execution result to the result file. By default, all SQL statement execution results will be written to the result file. If the result file is extremely long and unworthy of or unsuitable for verification, you can use the `disable_result_log` command to avoid writing the result to the result file.

Here is an example:

```bash
--disable_result_log
select count(*) from oceanbase.__all_server_table_stat where table_id>0;
select count(*) from oceanbase.__all_server_table_stat where table_id<=0;
select count(*) from oceanbase.__all_server_table_stat ;
--enable_result_log
```

## exit

Exits a test case. After you exit, mysqltest will not execute subsequent content of the test case. This command is usually used for loop or if judgments.
