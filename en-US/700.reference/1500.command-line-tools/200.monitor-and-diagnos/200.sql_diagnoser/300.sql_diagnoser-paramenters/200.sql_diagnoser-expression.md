# Diagnostic rule expression

You can modify the diagnostic rule expression. The following tables describe the syntax of the diagnostic rule expression of SQL Diagnoser.

## Data types

| Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------|
| Numeric | For example, 1, 1.1, and -2.3.  |
| String | For example, 'a' and "abc".  |
| Boolean | For example, `true` and `false`. The value is case-insensitive.  |
| Context variable | The class attribute, which is used to fetch object attributes from the context. A dollar sign (`$`) must be prefixed to each attribute, such as `$elapsedTime`.  </br>The value is case-sensitive.  |

## Object computing

| Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------|
| Attribute access | Specifies to access an attribute of an object. For example, `$a.b` specifies to access the `b` attribute of `a` in the context.  |
| Method access | Specifies to access a method of an object. Method access can be used together with attribute access. For example, `$a.f1()` specifies to access the `f1` method of `a` in the context. </br>Method access is not available for use now.  |

## Aggregate operation

| Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------|
| COUNT, AVG, STD, VAR, MIN, MAX, SUM, and DISTINCT | Specifies to perform operations on sets, which is the same as that in SQL.  |
| Set projection | Specifies to extract an attribute of each element in a set and form a new set, similar to projected columns in SQL. For example, if `$tableList` in `$tableList.tableName` is a set, the tableName attribute is extracted from each element to form a new set. </br>The value is case-insensitive.  |

## Relational operation

| Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------|
| !=/<>, =/==, <=, <, >=, and > | The same as that in SQL.  |
| IN | The same as that in SQL. It is used to determine whether an element exists in a set. </br>The value is case-insensitive.  |

## Boolean operation

| Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------               |
| AND, OR, and NOT | The same as that in SQL. The value is case-insensitive.  |

## Other operations

| Type | Description |
|-------------|----------------|
| ISNULL, NOTNULL, NOTEMPTY, and ISEMPTY | ISNULL and NOTNULL are used to determine whether an object exists. NOTEMPTY and ISEMPTY are used to determine whether a set is empty. </br>The value is case-insensitive.  |
