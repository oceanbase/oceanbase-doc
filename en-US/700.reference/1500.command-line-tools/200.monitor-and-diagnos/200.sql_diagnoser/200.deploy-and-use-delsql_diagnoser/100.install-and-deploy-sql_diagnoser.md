SQL Diagnoser must be installed in Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later.

## Prerequisites

The default port of SQL Diagnoser (8080) is not occupied. You can also customize a port.

2. Run the following command to install SQL Diagnoser:
   ```nohup java -jar /home/admin/sql-diagnoser-4.2.0.0.jar &```
