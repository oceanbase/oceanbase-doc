# Use obd.sh to run mysqltest

When you use `obd.sh` to run mysqltest for test, you must use an OceanBase database deployed by using `obd.sh`. This topic describes how to compile the source code, use `obd.sh` to deploy OceanBase Database, and run mysqltest for test.

## Background information

To simplify operations, we have encapsulated some commands of OceanBase Deployer (OBD) into the `obd.sh` script. The script is stored in the [oceanbase/tools/deploy](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/blob/master/tools/deploy/obd.sh) directory of the OceanBase source code. In this example, mysqltest calls the [obd test mysqltest](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000904958) command in OBD.

## Concepts

mysqltest runs entry tests for OceanBase Database. It uses a written test case file as the input and compares the database output against the expected output. mysqltest cases are all located in the [oceanbase/tools/deploy/mysql_test](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/tree/master/tools/deploy/mysql_test) directory of the OceanBase source code.

A case is the minimum execution unit of mysqltest, and contains at least one test file and one result file. A suite is a collection of cases of the same type.

mysqltest tests can be classified into different modes. Each mode consists of different nodes.

</main>

* c mode: Connect to the server node where the primary zone resides and run mysqltest. If the OceanBase cluster is deployed by using the `distributed.yaml` configuration file, connect to the cluster based on the settings in the `server1` section in the configuration file to run the test.

   ```shell
   ./obd.sh mysqltest -n <name> --suite acs --test-server=server1
   ```

* Slave mode: Connect to the server node where a non-primary zone resides to run mysqltest. If the OceanBase cluster is deployed by using the `distributed.yaml` configuration file, connect to the cluster based on the settings in the `server2` section in the configuration file to run the test.

   ```shell
   ./obd.sh mysqltest -n <name> --suite acs --test-server=server2
   ```

* Proxy mode: Use OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) to connect to an OceanBase cluster to run mysqltest. For example, use the `distributed-with-proxy.yaml` configuration file to deploy a cluster and run the test.

   ```shell
   ./obd.sh mysqltest -n <name> --all
   ```

## Procedure

This topic uses an x86 CentOS Linux 7.9 server as the environment. For more information about the compilation and deployment process, see [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/wiki/Compile).

### Step 1: Compile the source code of OceanBase Database

1. Download the source code of OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ git clone https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase.git
   ```

2. Prepare the dependency package based on the operating system.

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ sudo yum install git wget rpm* cpio make glibc-devel glibc-headers binutils m4
   ```

3. Perform compilation.

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ cd oceanbase
   [admin@obtest oceanbase]$ bash build.sh release --init --make
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy the compiled OceanBase file

1. Prepare the configuration file.

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ sudo yum install -y yum-utils
   [admin@obtest ~]$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
   [admin@obtest ~]$ sudo yum install -y libtool libaio obclient
   [admin@obtest ~]$ cd oceanbase/tools/deploy
   [admin@obtest deploy]$ ./obd.sh prepare
   ```

   The `obd.sh prepare` command copies the binary file from the compilation directory, such as build_release, creates an image, and then generates a default configuration file based on the current environment. If multiple compilation directories exist, the command selects the first one by default.

   You can use the default configuration file that is generated during the deployment. You can also download other configuration files from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/tree/master/example) and modify them as needed. You must select a configuration file based on the test mode of mysqltest.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>For more information about test modes of mysqltest, see <a href='#Concepts'>Concepts</a>. </p>
   </main>

   * You can use any configuration file to run a mysqltest test in c mode.

   * To run a mysqltest test in slave mode, you must use the `distributed.yaml` or `distributed-with-proxy.yaml` file to deploy a two-node cluster.

   * To run a mysqltest test in proxy mode, you must use the `distributed-with-proxy.yaml` file to deploy an OceanBase cluster and deploy ODP in the OceanBase cluster.

2. (Optional) Modify the configuration file.

   To modify the port and directory information in a configuration file, run the following command:

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest deploy]$ vim distributed-with-proxy.yaml
   ```

   The following table describes the key parameters.

   | Parameter | Required | Description |
   |------------|-----------|--------------------------------------|
   | servers | Yes | Specify each server in the format of `- name: server identifier (line feed) ip: server IP address`. You can specify multiple servers. The server identifiers must be unique. </br>You can specify unique server IP addresses in the format of `- <ip> (line feed)- <ip>`, where `- <ip>` is equivalent to `- name: server IP address (line feed) ip: server IP address`.  |
   | mysql_port | Yes | The port number for the SQL service protocol.  |
   | rpc_port | Yes | The port number for remote access, which is the RPC communication port between the observer process and other node processes.  |
   | home_path | Yes | The installation path of the component.  |
   | production_mode | Yes | Specifies whether to enable the production mode. If the production mode is enabled, mysqltest checks whether the server resources meet the production environment requirements. We recommend that you disable this mode for a test scenario. Otherwise, the deployment may fail.  |
   | devname | No | The network interface card (NIC) corresponding to the IP address specified in `servers`. You can view the mapping between IP addresses and NICs by using the `ip addr` command.  |
   | listen_port | Yes | The listening port of ODP.  |
   | prometheus_listen_port | Yes | The Prometheus service port of ODP.  |

3. Deploy OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest deploy]$ ./obd.sh deploy -c distributed-with-proxy.yaml -n test
   ```

   Here, `-c` specifies the path of the configuration file for deployment. In this example, the `distributed-with-proxy.yaml` file is used. `-n` specifies the name of the cluster to be deployed. In this example, `test` is used.

### Step 3: Run the mysqltest test

You can select a full test or specify the cases or suites for the test.

* Run the following commands to perform a full test, namely to run all suites in the `mysql_test/test_suite` directory:

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ cd oceanbase/tools/deploy
   [admin@obtest deploy]$ ./obd.sh mysqltest -n test --all
   ```

* Run the following commands to perform a test by specifying the test cases, for example, test cases in `mysql_test/test_suite/alter/t/alter_log_archive_option.test`:

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ cd oceanbase/tools/deploy
   [admin@obtest deploy]$ ./obd.sh mysqltest -n test --test-dir ./mysql_test/test_suite/alter/t --result-dir ./mysql_test/test_suite/alter/r --test-set alter_log_archive_option
   ```

* Run the following commands to perform a test by specifying the test suites, for example, suites in the `mysql_test/test_suite` directory:

   ```shell
   [admin@obtest ~]$ cd oceanbase/tools/deploy
   [admin@obtest deploy]$ ./obd.sh mysqltest -n test --suite acs
   ```

## Appendix

When you run a mysqltest test, you can configure options as required. The following table describes the options.

| Option | Required | Data type | Default value | Description |
|-------|---------|----------|-------|------|
| -n | Yes | String | Empty | The name of the cluster where the test is executed.  |
| --component | No | String | Empty | The name of the component to be tested. Valid values: `obproxy`, `obproxy-ce`, `oceanbase`, and `oceanbase-ce`. If you do not specify a value, the existence of `obproxy`, `obproxy-ce`, `oceanbase`, and `oceanbase-ce` is checked sequentially. The traversal stops when a component is found, and the component is then tested.  |
| --test-server | No | String | The name of the first node under the specified component. | You can set this parameter to the value of `name` in `servers` in the `.yaml` file. If `name` is not specified for the `servers` parameter, you can use the `ip` value. It must be a node under the specified component.  |
| --user | No | String | admin | The username used to perform the test. Generally, you do not need to modify the value.  |
| --password | No | String | admin | The user password used to perform the test.  |
