# ODC

OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) is a GUI-based database development tool. It is also a collaborative management platform for data development, production, and changes. ODC is provided in two forms: client ODC and web ODC. Client ODC focuses on database development. It is lightweight and easy to deploy on Windows, macOS, and Linux. As for web ODC, in addition to database development, web ODC also provides collaborative management features to ensure the security, compliance, and efficiency of database changes.

Web ODC allows you to work in Individual Workspace mode and Team Workspace mode. Individual Workspace is suitable for individual developers and allows you to use features of client ODC in a browser. You can access and create data sources as needed and develop databases with various windows and tools provided on the platform. Team Workspace is ideal for developers and database administrators (DBAs) to collaborate with each other. It is both a development tool and a collaborative management platform. ODC provides a variety of database development and management features, such as project collaboration, stable change, data security, and hot/cold data separation.

## Features

### Efficient development

To help you efficiently develop a database, ODC provides a variety of easy-to-use features, such as database object management, data import and export, SQL editing and execution, Compile and debug PL objects, data and schema processing, SQL analysis, and database O&M. To improve your user experience, ODC also allows you to drag objects to generate SQL statements and edit the result set as you do in Excel. It supports syntax highlighting and auto-completion of SQL statements, definition and reference of code snippets, and rapid generation of test data.

### Change risk management

ODC provides comprehensive solutions to ensure production security. The address, account, and password of a database are entered by the DBA, who then grants the access permissions to developers. This prevents the leakage of the account and password. ODC provides well-defined database development specifications. You can specify SQL check rules and SQL window blocking rules suitable for different environments. To minimize the change risks and ensure the stability of the production system, ODC may provide suggestions, submit your operations to DBA for approval, or block your operations, depending on the risk levels.

### Data security and compliance

ODC provides data desensitization and fine-grained audit capabilities to ensure data security and compliance. The comprehensive built-in desensitization algorithms and flexible identification rules keep sensitive data secure in scenarios such as when you access an SQL window or export some data from the database. This meets the regulatory requirements for private data security. ODC also supports operation auditing and SQL auditing. All operations performed in ODC are synchronized to the operation records center. All SQL requests initiated in ODC are also recorded.

### Data lifecycle management

ODC provides data lifecycle management capabilities to help you process your data. You can clean up and archive your data and specify partitioning plans. By creating a data cleanup task, you can regularly clean up expired data in business tables to reduce the size of online databases. By creating a data archiving task, you can separate hot and cold data based on flexible archiving settings. By creating a partitioning plan, you can add and delete partitions as needed to automatically maintain table partitions.

### Integration with open platforms

ODC supports single sign-on (SSO) and integration with external ticket review systems, SQL review systems, and bastion hosts. ODC supports the OAuth2 and OIDC protocols for SSO. ODC supports business process management software (BPMS) and custom systems for ticket review. ODC allows you to review SQL statements on the existing SQL review platform of your enterprise. ODC can be integrated with a bastion host for automatic logon based on the authentication of a one-time token. The feature of the automatic population of the database account and password is also supported.

### Efficient collaboration

ODC is designed to boost your productivity. You can import data by batch rather than manually entering records one after another. In a project, the OWNER role manages all databases and members of the project, and the DBA role manages all databases. A DEVELOPER role is granted the access permissions required for database development. You can add a collaborator to a project for teamwork without complex permission configuration. You can specify automatic authorization rules to automatically authorize visitors when they meet the authorization conditions.
