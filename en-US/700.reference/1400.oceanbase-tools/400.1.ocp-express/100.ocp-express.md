# OCP Express

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) Express is a web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x. Integrated with OceanBase clusters, OCP Express allows you to view key performance metrics and perform basic database management operations on OceanBase clusters. OCP Express is derived from OCP. It retains the core capabilities of OCP and adjusts the overall layout of features to provide a brand-new user experience. Feature configurations are also rearranged in OCP Express so that OCP Express can be deployed on any database node with the minimum resource consumption. OCP Express allows you to gain extensive control over OceanBase Database V4.x at minimum costs.

## Features

OCP Express supports the following five cluster management features:

* Cluster overview: allows you to view core information such as the topology, status information, resource consumption, and slow SQL statements of the cluster.
* Tenant management: allows you to manage tenants in the cluster, such as tenant creation, tenant deletion, database management, and parameter management.
* Monitoring center: provides monitoring data at the cluster and tenant levels and covers a wide range of monitoring metrics such as performance monitoring and host monitoring.
* Diagnostics center: allows you to effectively manage tenant sessions and slow SQL statements, such as closing sessions and enabling SQL throttling.
* Log service: allows you to analyze the related logs of OBServer nodes, OCP-Agent, and hosts to facilitate troubleshooting.

## Architecture

OCP Express adopts the **Agent-Server** architecture with the following characteristics:

* The OCP Express server can be deployed on any OBServer node or a separate node.
* The OCP-Agent service is deployed on each OBServer node. It interacts with the OCP server and executes O&M operations sent by the OCP server.
* The metadata and monitoring data of OCP Express are stored in a separate tenant in the database cluster. The tenant that stores the data of OCP Express is isolated from business tenants, and no additional cluster is needed to store the data of OCP Express.
* OCP Express manages only one OceanBase cluster, which simplifies the logic and enhances capabilities.

## Installation and deployment

OCP Express is deeply integrated with the OceanBase cluster. You can download the all-in-one package of OceanBase Database and select OCP Express during deployment.

* Obtain the all-in-one package of OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition or OceanBase Database Community Edition in [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).
<!-- * You can deploy OCP Express by using commands or on the GUI. For more information, see [Deploy OCP Express by using commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000862277) and [Deploy OCP Express on the GUI](https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-cn-10000000001690695). -->

After deployment, you can perform O&M operations on the OceanBase cluster, which includes modifying deployment configurations, starting the cluster, restarting the cluster, and more. For more information, see [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000001082230).

### Configuration requirements

OCP Express incurs high computing and storage overhead when it is running. Therefore, you must plan resources based on the size of the managed OceanBase cluster.

The following table lists the resource overhead of the OCP Express server The following table lists the resource overheads of the OCP Express server on the premises that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the required resources based on your business requirements.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|---|----|---|---|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 2 | 20 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 4 | 20 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 8 | 20 |

<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Plan the resource configurations of the OCP Express server based on the preceding overhead data and the consumption of other resources in the system. For system stability purposes, we recommend that you deploy OCP Express on a server that has at least four CPU cores and eight GB of memory. When a single host runs 10 tenants or fewer, we still recommend that you deploy OCP Express on a server that has four CPU cores and eight GB of memory. </p>
</main>

### MetaDB resources

MetaDB stores the metadata and monitoring data of OCP Express. We recommend that you create a separate tenant for MetaDB in your OceanBase cluster.

The CPU, memory, and disk resources for each replica of the MetaDB tenant are recommended based on the number of OBServer nodes managed by OCP Express. The following table lists the resource overheads of the OCP Express server on the premises that each cluster contains 10 tenants. You can calculate the required resources based on your business requirements.

| Number of servers to be managed | CPU (core) | Memory (GB) | Disk (GB) |
|---|----|---|---|
| ≤ 10 | 1 | 4 | 50 |
| ≤ 20 | 2 | 8 | 100 |
| ≤ 50 | 4 | 16 | 200 |

## FAQ

* What are the differences between OCP Express and OCP?

   OCP Express is intended for lightweight O&M management and is integrated with the managed OceanBase cluster for dedicated management. It minimizes resource consumption while meeting basic O&M requirements. OCP is intended for the O&M of large-scale complex clusters, and you can manage multiple OceanBase clusters in OCP. It provides more management capabilities than OCP Express. An additional OceanBase cluster is needed to store the data of OCP, and higher resource configurations are needed to implement the capabilities of OCP.

* Can OCP Express be separately deployed?

   At present, OCP Express must be installed and deployed by using the all-in-one package of OceanBase Database. After deployment, you can directly use OCP Express to manage your OceanBase cluster without configuration.

* What are the application scenarios of OCP Express?

   OCP Express applies to the O&M of an OceanBase cluster in a test environment with no more than 20 servers and 3 to 5 tenants.
