# Use a DBLink to modify data in a remote database

After you create a DBLink, you can use the DBLink to modify data in the remote database. DBLinks allow you to write data to Oracle Database or the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database.

## Limitations

* When using DBLink for write operations, if the remote database is an OceanBase database, the remote OceanBase database version must be V4.1.0 or above. If the remote database is an Oracle database, we recommend that you use Oracle 11g or above.

* The data write feature of DBLink supports reverse links. The remote database can access objects, such as tables, views, and synonyms, in the local database through a reverse link. To use the reverse link feature, you must provide information about the local database, such as the `ip`, `port`, `user_name`, `tenant_name`, and `pass_word`, when you create a DBLink. For more information, see [Create a DBLink](../1000.manage-dblink-of-oracle-mode/100.create-a-dblink-of-oracle-mode.md).

* The current reverse link feature only supports access between Oracle schemas in OceanBase databases and Oracle schemas in OceanBase databases. It does not currently support access between Oracle schemas in OceanBase databases and Oracle databases. 

## Prerequisites

* You have created a DBLink. For more information about how to create a DBLink, see [Create a DBLink](100.create-a-dblink-of-oracle-mode.md).

* When you use a DBLink to access a remote Oracle database, if the local OceanBase database is of V4.2.1 or later, you must install and configure Oracle Call Interface (OCI) 12.2 in the local OceanBase database, and if the local OceanBase database is of a version earlier than V4.2.1, you must upgrade the OceanBase database to V4.2.1 and update the OCI 11.2 configurations to OCI 12.2 configurations.

   For more information about how to install and configure OCI 12.2, see [Install and configure OCI](600.install-and-configure-the-oci.md).

## Considerations

* When you use a DBLink to write data to a remote database, OceanBase Database automatically enables local and remote XA transactions.

   For more information about XA transactions, see [XA transactions](../../../100.oceanbase-database-concepts/800.transaction-management/100.transaction/900.xa-transactions.md).

* After you write data to the remote database by using a DBLink, you must use the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement to commit or roll back the local and remote XA transactions.

   For more information about transaction control statements, see [Transactions](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/600.transaction-in-develop-of-oracle-mode/100.transaction-management-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

* When you use a DBLink to write data to a remote database, you cannot enable auto commit by setting the `autocommit` variable to `True`. In addition, when an XA transaction is enabled, the system forcibly sets `autocommit` to `False` for the current session and restores `autocommit` to its original value only after the XA transaction is committed or rolled back.

   The system variable `autocommit` specifies whether to enable auto commit of transactions. The default value is `True`. For more information about the system variable `autocommit`, see [autocommit](../../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/200.system-variable/300.global-system-variable/600.autocommit-global.md).

* If an XA transaction is expected to take a long time, you can use the `set ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;` statement to increase the transaction timeout period in advance to prevent unexpected errors due to the timeout of the XA transaction.

   The system variable `ob_trx_timeout` specifies the timeout period of transactions. The default value is `86400000000`, in microseconds. For more information about the system variable `ob_trx_timeout`, see [ob_trx_timeout](../../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/200.system-variable/300.global-system-variable/10300.ob_trx_timeout-global.md).

## Modify data in a remote database

You can use a DBLink to modify the data in a remote database by using the following types of DML statements: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE INTO`, and `DELETE`.

### Insert data

The syntax for inserting data into a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO table_name@dblink_name (list_of_columns) VALUES (list_of_values);
```

where

* In `table_name@dblink_name`, `table_name` specifies the name of the target table in the remote database, and `dblink_name` specifies the DBLink name.

* `list_of_columns` specifies the table columns into which the data will be inserted.

* `list_of_values` specifies the values of the columns specified by the `list_of_columns` parameter. The values and columns must be fully matched.

Here is an example of inserting a row `(11,11)` into the `t1` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM t1@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
+------+------+
1 row in set

obclient> INSERT INTO t1@ob_dblink VALUES (11,11);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
|   11 |   11 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set
```

Inserting data into a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly inserting data into a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to insert data into a table, see [Insert data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/100.insert-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `INSERT` statement, see [INSERT](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/200.insert-of-oracle-mode.md).

### Update data

The syntax for updating the data of a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> UPDATE table_name@dblink_name
SET column_name = value [, column_name = value]...
[WHERE condition];
```

where

* In `table_name@dblink_name`, `table_name` specifies the name of the target table in the remote database, and `dblink_name` specifies the DBLink name.

* `column_name = value [, column_name = value]` specifies the columns to be updated. The `value` after the equal sign (=) is the new value.

* `WHERE condition` specifies the condition that must be met by the rows to be updated. If no condition is specified, all rows of the corresponding columns are updated.

Here is an example of changing the value of the `C1` column to `3` for the `t2` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SET ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t2@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    2 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 row in set

obclient> UPDATE t2@ob_dblink SET C1 = 3;
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t2@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    3 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 rows in set
```

Updating the data of a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly updating the data of a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to update the data of a table, see [Update data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/200.update-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `UPDATE` statement, see [UPDATE](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/600.update-of-oracle-mode.md).

### Replace data

The syntax for replacing the data of a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> MERGE INTO table_name@dblink_name alias1
USING (table|view|sub_query) alias2
ON (join condition)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE table_name
    SET col1 = col1_val,
        col2 = col2_val
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (column_list) VALUES (column_values);
```

where

* `MERGE INTO table_name@dblink_name alias1` specifies the name and alias of the target table in the remote database, where `dblink_name` is the name of the DBLink.

* `USING (table|view|sub_query) alias2` specifies the name and alias of the source table, view, or subquery.

* `ON (join condition)` specifies the condition based on which the specified operation is performed.

* `WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE table_name SET col1 = col_val1 , col2 = col2_val` specifies that when the condition is met, the `UPDATE` statement is executed.

* `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (column_list) VALUES (column_values);` specifies that when the condition is not met, the `INSERT` statement is executed.

When you use a `MERGE INTO` statement to replace data, if the record in the source table does not exist in the destination table, data is inserted into the destination table. Otherwise, the existing record in the destination table is updated.

Here is an example of replacing data of the `t3` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM t3@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    3 |    3 |
|    4 |    4 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM t4;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    5 |    5 |
|    6 |    6 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> MERGE INTO t3@orcl_dblink a
 USING (SELECT C1,C2 FROM t4 ) b
 ON (a.C1 = b.C1)
 WHEN MATCHED THEN
     UPDATE SET a.C2 = b.C2
 WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
     INSERT (a.C1,a.C2) VALUES(b.C1, b.C2);
Query OK, 2 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t3@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    3 |    3 |
|    4 |    4 |
|    5 |    5 |
|    6 |    6 |
+------+------+
4 row in set
```

Replacing the data of a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly replacing the data of a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to replace the data of a table, see [Replace data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/400.replace-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `MERGE INTO` statement, see [MERGE](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/300.merge-of-oracle-mode.md).

### Delete data

The syntax for deleting data from a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> DELETE FROM table_name@dblink_name [WHERE condition];
```

where

* In `table_name@dblink_name`, `table_name` specifies the name of the target table in the remote database, and `dblink_name` specifies the DBLink name.

* `WHERE condition` specifies the condition that must be met by the data to be deleted. If no condition is specified, all data in the table is deleted.

Here is an example of deleting the row where `C2 = 7` from the `t5` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SET ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t5@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    7 |    7 |
|    8 |    8 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> DELETE FROM t5@orcl_dblink WHERE C2 = 7;
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t5@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    8 |    8 |
+------+------+
1 row in set
```
