# Use a DBLink to modify data in a remote database

After you create a DBLink, you can use the DBLink to modify data in the remote database. DBLinks allow you to write data to Oracle Database or the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database.

## Limitations

* When you use a DBLink for write operations, the version of the remote database must be V4.1.0 or later if it is an OceanBase database, and be 11g or later if it is an Oracle database.

* The data write feature of DBLink supports reverse links. The remote database can access objects, such as tables, views, and synonyms, in the local database through a reverse link. To use the reverse link feature, you must provide information about the local database, such as the `ip`, `port`, `user_name`, `tenant_name`, and `pass_word`, when you create a DBLink. For more information, see [Create a DBLink](../1000.manage-dblink-of-oracle-mode/100.create-a-dblink-of-oracle-mode.md).

* The reverse link feature supports only the access between two OceanBase databases in Oracle mode.

## Prerequisites

* You have created a DBLink. For more information about how to create a DBLink, see [Create a DBLink](100.create-a-dblink-of-oracle-mode.md).

* When you use a DBLink to access a remote Oracle database, if the local OceanBase database is of V4.2.1 or later, you must install and configure Oracle Call Interface (OCI) 12.2 on all OBServer nodes in the cluster. If the local OceanBase database was upgraded from an earlier version to V4.2.1 or later, you must upgrade the originally configured OCI 11.2 to OCI 12.2.

   For more information about how to install and configure OCI 12.2, see [Install and configure OCI](600.install-and-configure-the-oci.md).

## Considerations

* When you use a DBLink to write data to a remote database, OceanBase Database automatically enables local and remote XA transactions.

   For more information about XA transactions, see [XA transactions](../../../100.oceanbase-database-concepts/800.transaction-management/100.transaction/900.xa-transactions.md).

* After you write data to the remote database by using a DBLink, you must use the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` statement to commit or roll back the local and remote XA transactions.

   For more information about transaction control statements, see [Overview](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/600.transaction-in-develop-of-oracle-mode/100.transaction-management-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

* When you use a DBLink to write data to a remote database, you cannot enable auto commit by setting the `autocommit` variable to `True`. In addition, when an XA transaction is enabled, the system forcibly sets `autocommit` to `False` for the current session and restores `autocommit` to its original value only after the XA transaction is committed or rolled back.

   The system variable `autocommit` specifies whether to enable auto commit of transactions. The default value is `True`. For more information about the system variable `autocommit`, see [autocommit](../../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/200.system-variable/300.global-system-variable/400.autocommit-global.md).

* If an XA transaction is expected to take a long time, you can use the `set ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;` statement to increase the transaction timeout period in advance to prevent unexpected errors due to the timeout of the XA transaction.

   The system variable `ob_trx_timeout` specifies the timeout period of transactions. The default value is `86400000000`, in microseconds. For more information about the system variable `ob_trx_timeout`, see [ob_trx_timeout](../../../800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/200.system-variable/300.global-system-variable/9700.ob_trx_timeout-global.md).

* After you call a remote user-defined function (UDF) over a DBLink, in SQL, you must use the `COMMIT` statement to commit local and remote XA transactions, and you cannot set `autocommit` to `True` to enable auto commit of transactions. In PL, you can set `autocommit` to `True` to enable auto commit of transactions.

## Modify data in a remote database

You can use a DBLink to modify the data in a remote database by using the following types of DML statements: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `MERGE INTO`, and `DELETE`.

### Insert data

The syntax for inserting data into a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO table_name@dblink_name (list_of_columns) VALUES (list_of_values);
```

where:

* In `table_name@dblink_name`, `table_name` specifies the name of the target table in the remote database, and `dblink_name` specifies the DBLink name.

* `list_of_columns` specifies the table columns into which the data will be inserted.

* `list_of_values` specifies the values of the columns specified by the `list_of_columns` parameter. The values and columns must be fully matched.

Here is an example of inserting a row `(11,11)` into the `t1` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM t1@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
+------+------+
1 row in set

obclient> INSERT INTO t1@ob_dblink VALUES (11,11);
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    1 |    1 |
|   11 |   11 |
+------+------+
2 rows in set
```

Inserting data into a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly inserting data into a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to insert data into a table, see [Insert data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/100.insert-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `INSERT` statement, see [INSERT](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/200.insert-of-oracle-mode.md).

#### Insert data of a local table into a remote table

The syntax for writing data from a local table to a remote table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name@dblink_name[(list_of_columns)] SELECT * FROM table_name_list [WHERE query_condition];

table_name_list:
    table_name_local [, table_name_local ...] [, table_name_dblink@dblink_name_select ...]
```

The parameters are described as follows:

* `table_name@dblink_name`:

   * `table_name` specifies the name of the remote table where data is to be inserted.
   * `dblink_name` specifies the name of the DBLink created at the local database and directed to the remote database.

* `list_of_columns`: the list of columns in the target table where data is to be inserted. This parameter is optional. If you do not specify this parameter, the SQL statement matches the columns of the source table against those of the target table in order and inserts data into all columns of the target table that are specified in the `SELECT` clause.

* `table_name_local`: the name of the source table in the local database.

* `table_name_dblink@dblink_name`:

   * `table_name_dblink` specifies the name of the source table in the remote database.
   * `dblink_name_select` specifies the name of the DBLink used to access the source table in the remote database.

* `WHERE query_condition`: the conditions in the `SELECT` statement. `query_condition` specifies the rows of the source table to be inserted into the destination table. This parameter is optional.

Here is an example:

1. Query data of the local table `tbl1`.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CCC  |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Query data of the `a_tbl1` table in remote database A.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM a_tbl1@ob_dblink_a;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Empty set
   ```

3. Query data of the `b_tbl1` table in remote database B.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AA   |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CC   |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

4. Access the remote table `b_tbl1` over the `ob_dblink_b` DBLink, and select records that match the `col1` and `col2` columns of the `b_tbl1` table from the local table `tbl1`. Then insert the selected values of the `col1` and `col2` columns into the remote table `a_tbl1` over the `ob_dblink_a` DBLink.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> INSERT INTO a_tbl1@ob_dblink_a
     SELECT t1.col1, t1.col2 FROM tbl1 t1, b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b t2
     WHERE t1.col1 = t2.col1
     AND t1.col2 = t2.col2;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   ```

5. Query data of the `a_tbl1` table in remote database A again.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM a_tbl1@ob_dblink_a;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    2 | BBB  |
   +------+------+
   1 row in set
   ```

### Update data

The syntax for updating the data of a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> UPDATE table_name@dblink_name
SET column_name = value [, column_name = value]...
[WHERE condition];
```

where:

* In `table_name@dblink_name`, `table_name` specifies the name of the target table in the remote database, and `dblink_name` specifies the DBLink name.

* `column_name = value [, column_name = value]` specifies the columns to be updated. The `value` after the equal sign (=) is the new value.

* `WHERE condition` specifies the condition that must be met by the rows to be updated. If no condition is specified, all rows of the corresponding columns are updated.

Here is an example of changing the value of the `C1` column to `3` for the `t2` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SET ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t2@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    2 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 row in set

obclient> UPDATE t2@ob_dblink SET C1 = 3;
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t2@ob_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    3 |    2 |
+------+------+
1 rows in set
```

Updating the data of a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly updating the data of a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to update the data of a table, see [Update data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/200.update-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `UPDATE` statement, see [UPDATE](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/600.update-of-oracle-mode.md).

#### Update data of a local table to a remote table

Here is an example:

1. Query data of the local table `tbl1`.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CCC  |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Query data of the `b_tbl1` table in remote database B.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AA   |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CC   |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

3. Update the remote table `b_tbl1` over the `ob_dblink_b` DBLink to change the values of the `col2` column in the `b_tbl1` table to values of the `col2` column in the local table `tbl1`. Only the rows in the `b_tbl1` table whose `col1` column values match those of the `tbl1` table are updated.

   ```shell
   UPDATE b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b t1
       SET t1.col2 = (SELECT t2.col2
                     FROM tbl1 t2
                     WHERE t2.col1 = t1.col1)
       WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
                     FROM tbl1 t2
                     WHERE t2.col1 = t1.col1);
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Query OK, 3 rows affected
   Rows matched: 0  Changed: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

4. Query data of the `b_tbl1` table in remote database B again.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CCC  |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

### Replace data

The syntax for replacing the data of a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> MERGE INTO table_name@dblink_name alias1
USING (table|view|sub_query) alias2
ON (join condition)
WHEN MATCHED THEN
    UPDATE table_name
    SET col1 = col1_val,
        col2 = col2_val
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
    INSERT (column_list) VALUES (column_values);
```

where:

* `MERGE INTO table_name@dblink_name alias1` specifies the name and alias of the target table in the remote database, where `dblink_name` is the name of the DBLink.

* `USING (table|view|sub_query) alias2` specifies the name and alias of the source table, view, or subquery.

* `ON (join condition)` specifies the condition based on which the specified operation is performed.

* `WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE table_name SET col1 = col_val1 , col2 = col2_val` specifies that when the condition is met, the `UPDATE` statement is executed.

* `WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (column_list) VALUES (column_values);` specifies that when the condition is not met, the `INSERT` statement is executed.

When you use a `MERGE INTO` statement to replace data, if the record in the source table does not exist in the destination table, data is inserted into the destination table. Otherwise, the existing record in the destination table is updated.

Here is an example of replacing data of the `t3` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM t3@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    3 |    3 |
|    4 |    4 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM t4;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    5 |    5 |
|    6 |    6 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> MERGE INTO t3@orcl_dblink a
 USING (SELECT C1,C2 FROM t4 ) b
 ON (a.C1 = b.C1)
 WHEN MATCHED THEN
     UPDATE SET a.C2 = b.C2
 WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
     INSERT (a.C1,a.C2) VALUES(b.C1, b.C2);
Query OK, 2 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t3@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    3 |    3 |
|    4 |    4 |
|    5 |    5 |
|    6 |    6 |
+------+------+
4 row in set
```

Replacing the data of a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly replacing the data of a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to replace the data of a table, see [Replace data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/400.replace-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `MERGE INTO` statement, see [MERGE INTO](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/300.merge-of-oracle-mode.md).

#### Replace data of a remote table with data of a local table

Here is an example:

1. Query data of the local table `tbl1`.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CCC  |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Query data of the `b_tbl1` table in remote database B.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | B2   |
   |    5 | E5   |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

3. Update the remote table `b_tbl1` over the `ob_dblink_b` DBLink to change the values of the `col2` column in the `b_tbl1` table to values of the `col2` column in the local table `tbl1`. Only the rows in the `b_tbl1` table whose `col1` column values match those of the `tbl1` table are updated. If the source table `tbl1` contains rows whose `col1` column values do not match those of the `tbl1` table, the `INSERT` operation is executed to insert new rows into the target table `b_tbl1`. In this case, values of the `col1` and `col2` columns of the new rows in the `b_tbl1` table come from corresponding columns in the source table `tbl1`.

   ```shell
   MERGE INTO b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b t1
       USING tbl1 t2
           ON (t2.col1 = t1.col1)
       WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t1.col2 = t2.col2
       WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (t1.col1, t1.col2) VALUES(t2.col1, t2.col2);
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Query OK, 3 rows affected
   ```

4. Query data of the `b_tbl1` table in remote database B again.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM b_tbl1@ob_dblink_b;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    5 | E5   |
   |    3 | CCC  |
   +------+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

### Delete data

The syntax for deleting data from a table by using a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
obclient> DELETE FROM table_name@dblink_name [WHERE condition];
```

where:

* In `table_name@dblink_name`, `table_name` specifies the name of the target table in the remote database, and `dblink_name` specifies the DBLink name.

* `WHERE condition` specifies the condition that must be met by the data to be deleted. If no condition is specified, all data in the table is deleted.

Here is an example of deleting the row where `C2 = 7` from the `t5` table in the remote database connected through a DBLink:

```sql
obclient> SET ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t5@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    7 |    7 |
|    8 |    8 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> DELETE FROM t5@orcl_dblink WHERE C2 = 7;
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t5@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    8 |    8 |
+------+------+
1 row in set
```

Deleting the data of a table in a remote database by using a DBLink is similar to directly deleting the data of a table. The only difference is that you need to suffix `@dblink_name` to the name of the target table in the statement. For more information about how to delete the data of a table, see [Delete data](../../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/400.write-data-of-oracle-mode/300.delete-data-of-oracle-mode-in-develop.md).

For more information about the `DELETE` statement, see [DELETE](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/200.dml-of-oracle-mode/100.delete-of-oracle-mode.md).

#### Delete data from a remote table based on data of a local table

Here is an example:

1. Query data of the local table `tbl1`.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AAA  |
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    3 | CCC  |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

2. Query data of the `a_tbl1` table in remote database A.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM a_tbl1@ob_dblink_a;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    2 | BBB  |
   |    1 | AA1  |
   |    2 | BB2  |
   |    3 | CC3  |
   +------+------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

3. Delete rows in the remote table `a_tbl1` that match values of the `col1` and `col2` columns in the local table `tbl1`.

   ```shell
   DELETE FROM a_tbl1@ob_dblink_a t1
       WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1
                     FROM tbl1 t2
                     WHERE t2.col1 = t1.col1
                     AND t2.col2 = t1.col2
                   );
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   ```

4. Query data of the `a_tbl1` table in remote database A again.

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM a_tbl1@ob_dblink_a;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+
   | COL1 | COL2 |
   +------+------+
   |    1 | AA1  |
   |    2 | BB2  |
   |    3 | CC3  |
   +------+------+
   3 rows in set
   ```
