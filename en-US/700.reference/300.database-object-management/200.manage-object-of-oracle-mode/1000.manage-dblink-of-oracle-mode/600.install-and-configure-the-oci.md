# Install and configure OCI

When you use a DBLink in an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database to read data from or write data to a remote Oracle database, you must install and configure the Oracle Call Interface (OCI) library.

## Procedure

When you use a DBLink to access a remote Oracle database, if the local OceanBase database is of V4.2.1 or later, you must install and configure OCI 12.2 on all OBServer nodes in the cluster by referring to this topic.

The following example describes how to install and configure an OCI library on a single OBServer node.

1. Click [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/instant-client/linux-x86-64-downloads.html#license-lightbox) to go to the official website of OCI and download the OCI library of the corresponding version.

2. Log on to the OBServer node as the `admin` user, copy the downloaded RPM package to the OBServer node, and run the following command to install the OCI library:

   ```shell
   sudo rpm -ivh oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm
   ```

3. After the OCI library is installed, run the following command to obtain the OCI installation directory:

   ```shell
   rpm -ql oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64
   ```

   The result is as follows:

   ```shell
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/bin/adrci
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/bin/genezi
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libclntsh.so.12.1
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libclntshcore.so.12.1
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libipc1.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libmql1.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libnnz12.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libocci.so.12.1
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libociei.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libocijdbc12.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/libons.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/liboramysql12.so
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/ojdbc8.jar
   /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/xstreams.jar
   ```

4. Configure the OCI library.

   1. Check whether a `lib` directory exists in the OceanBase Database installation directory. If not, create one and specify privileges required to access the `lib` directory. If yes, skip this step.

      In this example, the OceanBase Database installation directory is `/home/admin/oceanbase`.

      ```shell
      sudo mkdir /home/admin/oceanbase/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      sudo chown admin:admin -R /home/admin/oceanbase/lib
      ```

   2. Go to the OCI installation directory.

      ```shell
      cd /usr/lib/oracle/12.2/client64/lib/
      ```

   3. Copy the following files from the OCI installation directory to the OceanBase Database installation directory: `libclntshcore.so.12.1`, `libclntsh.so.12.1`, `libipc1.so`, `libmql1.so`, `libnnz12.so`, `libocci.so.12.1`, `libociei.so`, `libocijdbc12.so`, `libons.so`, and `liboramysql12.so`.

      You need to replace `$DIR` with the OceanBase Database installation directory, which is `/home/admin/oceanbase` in this example.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>After you copy the <code>.so</code> files from the OCI installation directory to the OceanBase Database installation directory, you need to copy the <code>libclntsh.so.12.1</code> file in the OceanBase Database installation directory and rename the new file as <code>libclntsh.so</code>, or you can create a soft link that points to the <code>libclntsh.so.12.1</code> file in the installation directory and name the soft link as <code>libclntsh.so</code>. </p>
      </main>

      ```shell
      cp libclntshcore.so.12.1 $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libclntsh.so.12.1 $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libclntsh.so.12.1 $DIR/lib/libclntsh.so
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libipc1.so $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libmql1.so $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libnnz12.so $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libocci.so.12.1 $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libociei.so $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libocijdbc12.so $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp libons.so $DIR/lib
      ```

      ```shell
      cp liboramysql12.so $DIR/lib
      ```

5. Specify the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

   To load the `libclntsh.so` file, OceanBase Database searches for dependent library files in the directory specified by the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable. Therefore, you need to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable to the directory of the OCI library.

   In this example, the OCI library is located in `home/admin/oceanbase/lib`. Here is a sample command:

   ```javascript
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/admin/oceanbase/lib:"
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>You must append a colon (:) to <code>/home/admin/oceanbase/lib</code> when you configure environment variables. </p>
   </main>

6. After you configure the OCI library and the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, if the OBServer node fails to correctly load all the `.so` files of OCI, you need to restart the OBServer node. For more information, see [Restart a node](../../../../600.manage/100.cluster-management/300.common-cluster-operations/300.restart-a-node.md).

   If it is inconvenient to restart the OBServer node, you can run the `mv` command to move all the 10 `.so` files of the OCI library in the `$DIR/lib/` directory to the `/lib64` directory, and retain only the `libclntsh.so` file in the `$DIR/lib/` directory. Then, the OBServer node can load the OCI library without a restart.

   ```shell
   cd /home/admin/oceanbase/lib
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libclntshcore.so.12.1 /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libclntsh.so.12.1 /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libipc1.so /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libmql1.so /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libnnz12.so /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libocci.so.12.1 /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libociei.so /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libocijdbc12.so /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv libons.so /lib64
   ```

   ```shell
   mv liboramysql12.so /lib64
   ```

## Considerations

After you configure the OCI library on all OBServer nodes in the cluster, take note of the following considerations:

* OceanBase Database requires dependent libraries to load the OCI library. After you configure the OCI library, you can run the `ldd libclntsh.so` command in the directory of the OCI library, which is `home/admin/oceanbase/lib` in this example, to query other Linux libraries on which the OCI library depends. If the required dependent libraries do not exist, contact OceanBase Technical Support for assistance.

   ```shell
   ldd libclntsh.so
   ```

* On the x86 platform, OBServer nodes of V4.2.1 and later versions can only run OCI library files in the `oracle-instantclient12.2-basic-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm` package. If you use OCI library files of an earlier or later version or of multiple versions, processes may crash on the OBServer node.

   On the x86 platform, OBServer nodes of a version earlier than V4.2.1 can only run library files of OCI 11.2. For more information, see [Install and configure OCI 11.2](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001230647).

* On the ARM platform, OBServer nodes can only run OCI library files in the `oracle-instantclient19.10-basic-19.10.0.0.0-1.aarch64.rpm` package. To download the `oracle-instantclient19.10-basic-19.10.0.0.0-1.aarch64.rpm` package, click [oracle-instantclient19.10-basic-19.10.0.0.0-1.aarch64.rpm](https://yum.oracle.com/repo/OracleLinux/OL8/oracle/instantclient/aarch64/index.html).

   The process for configuring the OCI library on the ARM platform is similar to that of the x86 platform. You can configure all the `.so` files in the `oracle-instantclient19.10-basic-19.10.0.0.0-1.aarch64.rpm` package by referring to this topic.
