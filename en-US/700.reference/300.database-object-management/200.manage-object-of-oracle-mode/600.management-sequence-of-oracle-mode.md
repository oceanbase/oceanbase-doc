# Manage sequences

This topic describes how to create, query, modify, and drop sequences in Oracle mode.

In OceanBase Database, a sequence is a database object of Oracle tenants. You can use it to generate unique sequential values for the primary key column.

A sequence provides two pseudo-columns: `CURRVAL` and `NEXTVAL`, which return the current sequence value and the next sequence value respectively. Each reference to `NEXTVAL` will update the value of `CURRVAL`.

## Create a sequence

You can use the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement to create a sequence. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE sequence_name
[MINVALUE value | NOMINVALUE]
[MAXVALUE value | NOMAXVALUE]
[START WITH value]
[INCREMENT BY value]
[CACHE value | NOCACHE]
[ORDER | NOORDER]
[CYCLE | NOCYCLE];
```

where:

* `MINVALUE` and `MAXVALUE` specify the minimum and maximum values of the sequence.

* `START WITH` specifies the start value of the sequence.

* `INCREMENT BY` specifies the increment step. It can be negative. The default value is 1.

* `CACHE` specifies the number of sequence values to be cached for faster access. We recommend that you specify this parameter in high concurrency scenarios.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>When you use sequences in a distributed system, if you use the <code>CACHE</code> and <code>NOORDER</code> options at the same time, the sequence numbers that you obtain from connecting to different nodes are unique, but do not increase orderly. </p>
  </main>

* `CYCLE` specifies whether the values of the sequence are cyclically generated. If sequence values are cyclically generated, you must specify a minimum value and a maximum value.

For more information about the `CREATE SEQUENCE` statement, see [CREATE SEQUENCE](../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/2200.create-sequence-of-oracle-mode.md).

Example: Create a sequence to set a column as an auto-increment column.

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(id number NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(50) , gmt_create date NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATE);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE SEQUENCE seq_t1 START WITH 10000 INCREMENT BY 1 CACHE 50 NOCYCLE;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1(id,name) VALUES(seq_t1.nextval, 'A');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

obclient> INSERT INTO t1(id,name) VALUES(seq_t1.nextval, 'B');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

obclient> INSERT INTO t1(id,name) VALUES(seq_t1.nextval, 'C');
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+-------+------+---------------------+
| ID    | NAME | GMT_CREATE          |
+-------+------+---------------------+
| 10000 | A    | 2020-04-02 18:30:29 |
| 10001 | B    | 2020-04-02 18:30:34 |
| 10002 | C    | 2020-04-02 18:30:39 |
+-------+------+---------------------+
3 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

## Query sequences

You can use the `USER_SEQUENCES`, `ALL_SEQUENCES`, and `DBA_SEQUENCES` views to query sequences.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM USER_SEQUENCES \G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
SEQUENCE_NAME: SEQ_T1
    MIN_VALUE: 1
    MAX_VALUE: 9999999999999999999999999999
 INCREMENT_BY: 1
   CYCLE_FLAG: N
   ORDER_FLAG: N
   CACHE_SIZE: 50
  LAST_NUMBER: 10100
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
obclient>
```

* For more information about the fields in the `DBA_SEQUENCES` view, see [DBA_SEQUENCES](../../700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/19600.dba_sequences-of-oracle-mode.md).

* For more information about the fields in the `ALL_SEQUENCES` view, see [ALL_SEQUENCES](../../700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/3900.all_sequences-of-oracle-mode.md).

* For more information about the fields in the `USER_SEQUENCES` view, see [USER_SEQUENCES](../../700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/29500.user_sequences-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Modify a sequence

After you create a sequence, you can use the `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement to modify the attributes of the sequence.

OceanBase Database allows you to change the start value, minimum value, maximum value, increment step, and cycle of a sequence. The SQL syntax for modifying a sequence is as follows:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE sequence_name
  {
  [RESTART]
  |[START WITH int_value]
  |[ MINVALUE value | NOMINVALUE ]
  |[ MAXVALUE value | NOMAXVALUE ]
  |[ INCREMENT BY value ]
  |[ CACHE value | NOCACHE ]
  |[ ORDER | NOORDER ]
  |[ CYCLE | NOCYCLE]
  };
```

For more information about the `ALTER SEQUENCE` statement, see [ALTER SEQUENCE](../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/600.alter-sequence-of-oracle-mode.md).

Here is an example:

1. Change the maximum value of the `seq2` sequence and enable cyclic generation of sequence values.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq2 MAXVALUE 1024 CYCLE;
   ```

2. Change the start value of the sequence.

   * If the value of `INCREMENT BY` is greater than `0`, you can reset the sequence to make the sequence start from `MINVALUE`. If the value of `INCREMENT BY` is less than `0`, you can execute the following statement to reset the sequence to make the sequence start from `MAXVALUE`:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq3 RESTART;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   * Execute the following statement to reset the sequence and make the sequence start from `3`:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq4 RESTART START WITH 3;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected
      ```

   When you change the start value of a sequence, `RESTART` does not necessarily need to be behind the sequence name. It can be at any position in the statement. A sample statement is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SEQUENCE seq4 START WITH 3 RESTART MINVALUE -100 CYCLE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

## Drop a sequence

You can use the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement to drop a sequence. The syntax is as follows:

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE sequence_name;
```

For more information about the `DROP SEQUENCE` statement, see [DROP SEQUENCE](../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/3700.drop-sequence-of-oracle-mode.md).

Example: Drop a sequence named `S1`.

```sql
obclient> DROP SEQUENCE S1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```
