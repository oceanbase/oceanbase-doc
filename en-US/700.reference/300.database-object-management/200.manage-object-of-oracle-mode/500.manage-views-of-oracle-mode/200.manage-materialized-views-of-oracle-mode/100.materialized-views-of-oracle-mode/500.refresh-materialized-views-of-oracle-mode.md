# Refresh a materialized view

Data changes in the base table may result in data inconsistency with its materialized view. To maintain data consistency between base tables and materialized views, OceanBase Database supports refresh of materialized views. When a materialized view is refreshed, all its indexes are automatically updated. 

The refresh of a materialized view is performed in serial with the help of object locks. The base table is not locked during the refresh of a materialized view. This improves the concurrency performance. 

## Refresh mode

You can use the `ON DEMAND` clause to specify the manual on-demand refresh mode for a materialized view. 

You can use the `DBMS_MVIEW` package to manually refresh a materialized view, or set periodical refresh of a materialized view by using the `START WITH ... NEXT...` statement. 

## Refresh methods

### Full refresh

#### Prerequisite

To perform a full refresh of a materialized view, the column types of the materialized view must match those of the base table.  

#### Mechanism

OceanBase Database first creates a hidden table, executes refresh statements on the hidden table, and then replaces the original table with the hidden table. Therefore, a full refresh operation requires additional storage space. In addition, if the original table has indexes, all indexes are re-created. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>A full refresh may take a long time to complete, especially when the materialized view involves the read and processing of a large amount of data. Therefore, we recommend that you consider the time required before you perform a full refresh. </p>
</main>

### Incremental refresh

 <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>To perform an incremental refresh of a materialized view, you need to create a materialized view log on the base table before you create the materialized view. For information about how to create a materialized view log, see <a href="../200.materialized-views-log-of-oracle-mode/200.create-materialized-views-log-of-oracle-mode.md">Create a materialized view log</a>. </p>
 </main>

#### Considerations

* An incremental refresh does not support the `MAX` or `MIN` aggregate function. 
* An incremental refresh does not support complex scenarios, such as those involving inner join views, `UNION` operators, and subqueries. 
* An incremental refresh does not support expressions containing unstable outputs, such as `ROWNUM` and `RAND`. 
* An incremental refresh does not support `ROLLUP` or `HAVING`. 
* `DISTINCT` can be disabled or removed. This is because the selected output columns are unique in a materialized view that supports the incremental refresh. 
* An incremental refresh does not support `ORDER BY`. 
* An incremental refresh does not support window functions. 
* An incremental refresh supports scalar aggregate functions that do not contain a `GROUP BY` clause. 
* The incremental refresh of a materialized view that involves a `GROUP BY` clause supports only aggregate functions such as `SUM` and `COUNT`, and the aggregate functions can only use simple columns, and the output must contain `COUNT(*)` and `GROUP BY` columns. 

**The requirements for `GROUP BY` are as follows:**

1. The `GROUP BY` clause must be in standard `GROUP BY` syntax. `ROLLUP` and `HAVING` are not supported. 
2. The `SELECT` clause must contain all `GROUP BY` columns. 
3. The aggregate functions do not contain the `DISTINCT` keyword. The arguments of aggregate functions are columns of the base table. 
4. The `SELECT` clause can contain `COUNT(*)`, and supports aggregate functions except for the `MIN` and `MAX` functions. 

| **Aggregate function** | **Dependent columns that must be contained in the SELECT clause** |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| COUNT(*) | N/A |
| COUNT(expr) | N/A |
| SUM(expr) | COUNT(expr) or non-NULL expr |
| AVG(expr) | SUM(expr),COUNT(expr) |
| STDDEV(expr) | SUM(expr),COUNT(expr),SUM(expr * expr) |
| VARIANCE(expr) | SUM(expr),COUNT(expr),SUM(expr * expr) |
| Other aggregate functions that can be split into SUM and COUNT. Note that changes in calculation methods may cause changes in the precision. | SUM(col1),COUNT(col1) |

#### Examples

1. Create a table named `test_tbl1`. 

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE test_tbl1 (col1 NUMBER PRIMARY KEY, col2 NUMBER, col3 NUMBER, col4 NUMBER);
   ```

2. Create a materialized view log on the `test_tbl1` table. 

   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG ON test_tbl1
     WITH SEQUENCE (col2, col3) INCLUDING NEW VALUES;
   ```

3. Create a materialized view and specify the incremental refresh method. 

   * Create a materialized view named `mv1_test_tbl1`. Specify to manually perform the incremental refresh of the materialized view in ON DEMAND mode. Select the `col2` column in the `test_tbl1` table, calculate the aggregate results of `count(*)`, `count(col3)`, and `sum(col3)`, and group the results by the `col2` column. Then, record the results in the materialized view. 

      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv1_test_tbl1
        REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
        AS SELECT col2, count(*) cnt, count(col3) cnt_col3, sum(col3) sum_col3
           FROM test_tbl1
           GROUP BY col2;
      ```

   * Create a materialized view named `mv2_test_tbl1`. Specify to manually perform the incremental refresh of the materialized view in ON DEMAND mode. Based on the `test_tbl1` table, calculate the aggregate results of `count(*)`, `count(col3)`, and `sum(col3)`. Then, record the results in the materialized view. 

      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv2_test_tbl1
        REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
        AS SELECT count(*) cnt, count(col3) cnt_col3, sum(col3) sum_col3
           FROM test_tbl1;
      ```

   * Create a materialized view named `mv3_test_tbl1`. Specify to manually perform the incremental refresh of the materialized view in ON DEMAND mode. Based on the `test_tbl1` table, calculate the aggregate results of `count(col3)` and `sum(col3)`. Then, record the results in the materialized view. 

      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv3_test_tbl1
        REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
        AS SELECT count(col3) cnt_col3, sum(col3) sum_col3
           FROM test_tbl1;
      ```

   * Create a materialized view named `mv4_test_tbl1`. Specify to manually perform the incremental refresh of the materialized view in ON DEMAND mode. Select the `col2` and `col3` columns in the `test_tbl1` table, calculate the aggregate results of `count(*)`, `count(col3)`, and `sum(col3)`, and group the results by the `col2` and `col3` columns. Then, record the results in the materialized view. 

      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv4_test_tbl1
        REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
        AS SELECT col2, col3, count(*) cnt, count(col3) cnt_col3, sum(col3) sum_col3
           FROM test_tbl1
           GROUP BY col2, col3;
      ```

   * Create a materialized view named `mv5_test_tbl1`. Specify to manually perform the incremental refresh of the materialized view in ON DEMAND mode. Select the `col2` column in the `test_tbl1` table, calculate the aggregate results of `count(*)`, `count(col3)`, `sum(col3)`, and `avg(col3)`, calculate the custom `calcol1` and `calcol2` columns, and group the results by the `col2` column. Then, record the results in the materialized view. 

      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv5_test_tbl1
        REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
        AS SELECT col2, count(*) cnt, count(col3) cnt_col3, sum(col3) sum_col3, avg(col3) avg_col3, avg(col3) * sum(col3)/col2 calcol1, col2+sum(col3) calcol2
           FROM test_tbl1
           GROUP BY col2;
      ```

   * Create a materialized view named `mv6_test_tbl1`. Specify to manually perform the incremental refresh of the materialized view in ON DEMAND mode. Select the `col2` column in the `test_tbl1` table, and calculate the aggregate results of `count(*)`, `count(col3)`, `sum(col3)`, `count(col3*col3)`, `sum(col3*col3)`, and `STDDEV(col3)`, and group the results by the `col2` column. Then, record the results in the materialized view. 

      ```sql
      CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv6_test_tbl1
        REFRESH FAST ON DEMAND
        AS SELECT col2, count(*) cnt, count(col3) cnt_col3, sum(col3) sum_col3, count(col3*col3) cnt_col3_2, sum(col3*col3) sum_col3_2, STDDEV(col3) stddev_col3
           FROM test_tbl1
           GROUP BY col2;
      ```

## Manually refresh a materialized view

If you set the refresh mode of a materialized view to `ON DEMAND`, you can use the `DBMS_MVIEW` package to manually refresh the materialized view. 

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Only the owner of a materialized view and the tenant administrator can refresh the materialized view. </p>
</main>

### Refresh a materialized view by using `REFRESH`

```sql
DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH (
   list                   IN     VARCHAR2,                  -- The name of the materialized view. You can specify only one materialized view.
   method                 IN     VARCHAR2       := NULL,    -- The refresh options. Valid values:
                                                            --   f: Fast refresh
                                                            --   ?: Forcible refresh
                                                            --   C|c: Full refresh
                                                            --   A|a: Always refresh, which is equivalent to C
   ----------- The following parameters are provided for the compatibility with Oracle and do not take effect. ----------------
   rollback_seg           IN     VARCHAR2       := NULL,
   push_deferred_rpc      IN     BOOLEAN        := true,
   refresh_after_errors   IN     BOOLEAN        := false,
   purge_option           IN     BINARY_INTEGER := 1,
   parallelism            IN     BINARY_INTEGER := 0,
   heap_size              IN     BINARY_INTEGER := 0,
   atomic_refresh         IN     BOOLEAN        := true, 
   nested                 IN     BOOLEAN        := false,
   out_of_place           IN     BOOLEAN        := false,
   skip_ext_data          IN     BOOLEAN        := false,
   ---------------------------------------------------------
   refresh_parallel       IN     BINARY_INTEGER := 1);       -- The degree of parallelism (DOP) of the materialized view refresh operation. This parameter is supported only in OceanBase Database.
```

**Here is an example:**

1. Insert 3 data records to the `test_tbl1` table. 

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO test_tbl1 VALUES (1, 1, 1, 1),(2, 2, 2, 2),(3, 3, 3, 3);
   ```

2. Query the information about the `mv1_test_tbl1` materialized view. 

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mv1_test_tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   Empty set
   ```

3. Use `DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH` to manually refresh the `mv1_test_tbl1` materialized view. 

   ```sql
   CALL DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('mv1_test_tbl1');
   ```

4. Query the information about the `mv1_test_tbl1` materialized view again. 

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM mv1_test_tbl1;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +------+------+----------+----------+
   | COL2 | CNT  | CNT_COL3 | SUM_COL3 |
   +------+------+----------+----------+
   |    3 |    1 |        1 |        3 |
   |    2 |    1 |        1 |        2 |
   |    1 |    1 |        1 |        1 |
   +------+------+----------+----------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

### Refresh DOP

You can use the `refresh_parallel` option to specify the DOP of the refresh operation. This option supports only full refresh and does not take effect on incremental refresh. 

**Here is an example:**

Refresh the materialized view with a specified DOP. 

```sql
CALL DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH('mv3', refresh_parallel => 8);
```

## Automatically refresh a materialized view

If you specify the `START WITH datetime_expr` and `NEXT datetime_expr` clauses when you create a materialized view, a background automatic refresh task is created for the materialized view. 

### Refresh DOP

You can specify the DOP of a background automatic refresh task in the following three ways:

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p><ul><li>Priorities of the DOPs specified in the following ways decrease in sequence. </li><li>The refresh DOP takes effect only on the full refresh. </li><li>The following sample SQL statements cannot be executed. </li></ul></p>
</main>

1. Specify the refresh DOP in a hint. 

   **Here is an example:**

   ```sql
   CREATE /*+ parallel(8) */ MATERIALIZED VIEW ...
   ```

2. Specify the refresh DOP in the session variable of a DDL operation. 

   **Here is an example:**

   1. Enable the DOP of the DDL operation. 

      ```sql
      ALTER SESSION ENABLE PARALLEL DDL;
      ```

   2. Set the DOP value of the DDL operation.

      ```sql
      ALTER SESSION FORCE PARALLEL DDL PARALLEL 8;
      ```

3. Specify the table-level DOP when you create the materialized view. 

   **Here is an example:**

   ```sql
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW xxx PARALLEL 8 ...
   ```

## Statistics of materialized view refreshes

OceanBase Database can collect and store statistics of materialized view refreshes. You can query specific views to view the statistics. Statistics of both ongoing and historical materialized view refresh operations are stored in the database. Statistics of historical materialized view refreshes help you understand and analyze the performance of materialized view refreshes in the database. 

Statistics of materialized view refreshes provide the following benefits:

* Reporting: The system provides statistics overviews of ongoing and historical materialized view refresh operations, including the actual time required for executing the refresh. This help you track and monitor refresh performance. 

* Diagnostics: You can use detailed statistics on ongoing and historical materialized view refresh operations to effectively analyze the refresh performance. For example, if the refresh of a materialized view takes a long time, you can check the refresh statistics and identify whether the performance decrease is due to the increase in system workload or data changes. 

### Collect statistics on materialized views

OceanBase Database allows you to collect statistics on materialized views. You can use the `analyze table` or `call dbms_stats.gather_table_stats('database_name', 'table_name')` statement to collect statistics. 

* For more information about how to collect statistics on tables and columns, see [GATHER_TABLE_STATS](../../../../../500.sql-reference/300.pl-reference/300.pl-oracle/1400.pl-system-package-oracle/15900.dbms-stats-oracle/1700.gather-table-stats-oracle.md).
