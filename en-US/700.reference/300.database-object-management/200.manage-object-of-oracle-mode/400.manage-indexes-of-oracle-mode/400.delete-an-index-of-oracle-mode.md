# Drop an index

The maintenance overhead increases with the number of indexes. You can drop unnecessary indexes based on your needs.

The syntax for dropping an index is as follows:

```sql
DROP INDEX index_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP INDEX t3_ind2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
```
