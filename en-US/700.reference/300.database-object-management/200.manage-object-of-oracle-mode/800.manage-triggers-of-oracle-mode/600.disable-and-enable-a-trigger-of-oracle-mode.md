# Disable or enable a trigger

You can disable and enable triggers in some Procedural Language (PL) scenarios.

You may need to temporarily disable a trigger in the following scenarios:

* The trigger cannot be compiled because a database object that the trigger depends on does not exist.

* The logic of the trigger does not meet your business needs.

* You want to load, modify, or delete a large amount of data without executing any trigger.

You can enable a disabled trigger as needed.

You can use the `ALTER TRIGGER` statement in conjunction with a `DISABLE` or an `ENABLE` clause to enable or disable a trigger.

Disable a trigger by using the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER trigger_name DISABLE;
```

Enable a trigger by using the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER trigger_name ENABLE;
```

For more information about triggers, see [Query trigger information](../800.manage-triggers-of-oracle-mode/700.view-trigger-information-of-oracle-mode.md).
