# Manage synonyms

This topic describes how to create and drop synonyms.

In OceanBase Database, a synonym is an alias for a database object in a tenant. Synonyms facilitate privilege management. You can use synonyms to mask the owner privilege of data objects.

## Create a synonym

You can use the `CREATE SYNONYM` statement to create a synonym.

Take note of the following rules when you create a synonym:

* To create a private synonym for the current user, you must have the `CREATE SYNONYM` privilege.

* To create a private synonym for another user, you must have the `CREATE ANY SYNONYM` privilege.

* To create a public synonym, you must have the `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM` privilege.

* You can create a synonym for a non-existent object. You do not need to be authorized to access the object for which you want to create a synonym.

For information about how to query user privileges, see [Query user privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). For information about how to grant user privileges, see [Grant direct privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/200.authority-of-oracle-mode.md).

To create a synonym, use the following syntax:

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ PUBLIC ] SYNONYM [ schema. ]synonym FOR [ schema. ]object;
```

For more information about the `CREATE SYNONYM` statement, see SQL reference (Oracle mode).

Here are two examples:

* Create a private synonym.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE test(c1 int);
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.18 sec)

   obclient> CREATE SYNONYM s1 for test;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)

   obclient> INSERT INTO s1 VALUES(1);
   Query OK, 1 row affected (0.02 sec)

   obclient> SELECT * FROM s1;
   +------+
   | c1   |
   +------+
   |    1 |
   +------+
   1 row in set (0.01 sec)
   ```

* Create a public synonym.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM syn_pub FOR test;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)

   obclient> SELECT * FROM syn_pub;
   +------+
   | c1   |
   +------+
   |    1 |
   +------+
   1 row in set (0.01 sec)
   ```

## Drop a synonym

You can use the `DROP SYNONYM` statement to drop a synonym that you no longer need.

Take note of the following rules when you drop a synonym:

* To drop a private synonym, make sure that this private synonym is under the corresponding database or schema, and that you have the `DROP ANY SYNONYM` privilege.

* To drop a public synonym, you must have the `DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM` privilege.

   In addition, you must specify the `PUBLIC` keyword, and cannot specify the database or schema in the synonym dropping statement.

For information about how to query user privileges, see [Query user privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). For information about how to grant user privileges, see [Grant direct privileges](../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/300.permission-of-oracle-mode/200.authority-of-oracle-mode.md).

The syntax for dropping a synonym is as follows:

```sql
DROP [PUBLIC] SYNONYM [ schema. ]synonym;
```

For more information about the `DROP SYNONYM` statement, see OceanBase Database SQL Reference (Oracle Mode).

Here are two examples:

* Drop a private synonym.

   ```sql
   obclient> DROP SYNONYM test.s1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
   ```

* Drop a public synonym.

   ```sql
   obclient> DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM syn_pub;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
   ```
