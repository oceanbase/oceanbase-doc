# Query sequences

After you create a sequence, you can use the `SHOW SEQUENCES` statement or a view to query the sequence.

## Use the SHOW SEQUENCES statement to query sequences

The `SHOW SEQUENCES` statement allows you to query all sequences created in the current tenant.

Here is a sample statement:

```sql
obclient> SHOW SEQUENCES
              [LIKE expression
               | LIKE expression IN database_name
               | IN database_name
               | WHERE sequence_name='sequence_name'
              ];
```

where:

* `LIKE expression` specifies the information about the sequence name to be queried.

* `IN database_name` specifies the database to which the sequence to be queried belongs.

* `WHERE sequence_name='sequence_name'` specifies the name of the sequence to be queried.

Here are some examples:

* Query all sequences created in the current tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW SEQUENCES;
   +-------------------+
   | Sequences_in_test |
   +-------------------+
   | seq1              |
   | meq2              |
   +-------------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* Query all sequences whose name contains `s`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW SEQUENCES LIKE '%s%';
   +-------------------------+
   | Sequences_in_test (%s%) |
   +-------------------------+
   | seq1                    |
   +-------------------------+
   1 rows in set
   ```

* Query all sequences in the `test` database.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW SEQUENCES IN test;
   +-------------------+
   | Sequences_in_test |
   +-------------------+
   | seq1              |
   | meq2              |
   +-------------------+
   2 rows in set
   ```

* Query the sequence named `seq1` in the current tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW SEQUENCES WHERE sequence_name='seq1';
   +-------------------+
   | Sequences_in_test |
   +-------------------+
   | seq1              |
   +-------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

## Use a view to query sequences

In a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database, you can query all sequences by querying the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_SEQUENCE_OBJECTS` view that displays the sequence information such as the ID, name, start value, increment step, cycling flag, maximum value, and minimum value of the sequence, as well as the database to which the sequence belongs.

A sample query is as follows:

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_SEQUENCE_OBJECTS;
+-------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------------+
| SEQUENCE_ID | SCHEMA_VERSION   | DATABASE_ID | SEQUENCE_NAME | MIN_VALUE | MAX_VALUE | INCREMENT_BY | START_WITH | CACHE_SIZE | ORDER_FLAG | CYCLE_FLAG | IS_SYSTEM_GENERATED |
+-------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------------+
|      500003 | 1675748057234736 |      500002 | seq1          |         1 |        10 |            2 |          1 |         30 |          0 |          0 |                   0 |
+-------------+------------------+-------------+---------------+-----------+-----------+--------------+------------+------------+------------+------------+---------------------+
1 row in set
```
