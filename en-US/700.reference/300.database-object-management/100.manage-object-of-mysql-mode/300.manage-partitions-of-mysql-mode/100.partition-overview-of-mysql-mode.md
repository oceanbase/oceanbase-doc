# Overview

This topic introduces the basic concepts and types of partitioning in OceanBase Database.

## Basic concepts

OceanBase Database can split the data of a table into different groups based on some rules. Data in the same group is stored in the same physical area. This area is called a partition. A table split in this way is called a partitioned table. In the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, you can create at most 8,192 partitions in a single table.

For example, the following figure shows a table that consists of five partitions, which are distributed across two nodes.

Each partition can be divided into subpartitions based on some rules. A table that contains both partitions and subpartitions is called a subpartitioned table.

In a table row, a column determines which partition the row belongs to. The set of data in this column is called the partitioning key. The partitioning key must be a subset of a primary key or a unique key. An expression contains the partitioning key and determines which partitions the rows belong to. This expression is called a partitioning expression.

## Partitioning types

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database supports the following partitioning types:

* RANGE partitioning

* RANGE COLUMNS partitioning

* LIST partitioning

* LIST COLUMNS partitioning

* HASH partitioning

* KEY partitioning

* Composite partitioning

### RANGE partitioning

RANGE partitioning maps data to partitions based on ranges of partitioning key values that you set up for each partition when you define the partitioned table. It is the most common partitioning type and is often used with dates. For example, you can partition business log tables by day, week, or month.

In RANGE partitioning, the partitioning key must be of the integer or YEAR type. If a field of another type is used as the partitioning key, you must use a function for conversion. In addition, the partitioning key must be a single column.

### RANGE COLUMNS partitioning

RANGE COLUMNS partitioning is similar to RANGE partitioning, but they are different in the following aspects:

* In RANGE COLUMNS partitioning, the values of the partitioning key do not necessarily need to be integers. The following data types are supported:

   * All integer types: TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT ( INTEGER), and BIGINT

      Columns of other numeric data types, such as DECIMAL or FLOAT, cannot be used as the partitioning key.

   * Time types: DATE and DATETIME

      Columns of other date or time data types cannot be used as the partitioning key.

   * Character types: CHAR, VARCHAR, BINARY, and VARBINARY

      Columns of the TEXT or BLOB data type cannot be used as the partitioning key.

* You cannot use an expression as the partitioning key for RANGE COLUMNS partitioning.

* The partitioning key for RANGE COLUMNS partitioning can contain multiple columns (column vectors).

### LIST partitioning

Unlike RANGE partitioning and HASH partitioning, LIST partitioning enables you to explicitly control how rows map to partitions by specifying a list of discrete values for the partitioning key in the description for each partition. The advantage of LIST partitioning is that you can partition unordered and unrelated data.

In LIST partitioning, the partitioning key can be a column name or an expression. However, the data type of the partitioning key must be integer or YEAR.

### LIST COLUMNS partitioning

LIST COLUMNS partitioning is similar to LIST partitioning, but they are different in the following aspects:

* In LIST COLUMNS partitioning, the values of the partitioning key do not necessarily need to be integers. The following data types are supported:

   * All integer types: TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT ( INTEGER), and BIGINT

      Columns of other numeric data types, such as DECIMAL or FLOAT, cannot be used as the partitioning key.

   * Time types: DATE and DATETIME

      Columns of other date or time data types cannot be used as the partitioning key.

   * Character types: CHAR, VARCHAR, BINARY, and VARBINARY

      Columns of the TEXT or BLOB data type cannot be used as the partitioning key.

* The partitioning key for LIST COLUMNS partitioning cannot be an expression.

* LIST COLUMNS partitioning supports multiple partitioning keys, whereas LIST partitioning supports only one partitioning key.

### HASH partitioning

HASH partitioning applies to scenarios where RANGE partitioning or LIST partitioning cannot be used. HASH partitioning enables easy partitioning of data by distributing records over partitions based on a HASH function on the partitioning key. HASH partitioning is a better choice in the following cases:

* You cannot identify an obvious partitioning key for the data.

* The sizes of range partitions differ substantially or are difficult to balance manually.

* RANGE partitioning can cause the data to be undesirably clustered.

* Performance features such as parallel DML, partition pruning, and partition-wise joins are important.

In HASH partitioning, the partitioning key must be of the integer or YEAR type and can be an expression.

### KEY partitioning

KEY partitioning is similar to HASH partitioning. They both use the modulus operation to determine which partition the requested data belongs to.

KEY partitioning has the following characteristics:

* In KEY partitioning, the values of the partitioning key do not necessarily need to be integers. Data types other than TEXT and BLOB are supported.

* You cannot use an expression as the partitioning key.

* You can use a vector as the partitioning key.

* If you do not specify any column as the partitioning key, the primary key is used as the partitioning key.

   Here is an example:

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1 (col1 INT PRIMARY KEY, col2 INT)
          PARTITION BY KEY()
          PARTITIONS 5;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

### Composite partitioning

Composite partitioning partitions a table using one partitioning strategy and partitions each partition using a different partitioning strategy. It is suitable for business tables containing large amounts of data. Composite partitioning gives full play to the advantages of the two partitioning strategies that you use in combination.

### Considerations

If you use auto-increment columns as the partitioning key in the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, note that:

* In OceanBase Database, each value in an auto-increment column is globally unique but may not be incremental within a partition.

* For a partitioned table that uses auto-increment columns as the partitioning key, insert operations may initiate cross-server transactions due to the lack of efficient routing. This degrades the performance.

## Partition naming conventions

For a LIST- or RANGE-partitioned table, the partition names are specified when the table is created.

For a HASH- or KEY-partitioned table, if no partition names are specified when the table is created, the system generates the names based on the following naming conventions: The specific process is as follows:

* If HASH or KEY is used as the partitioning strategy, the partitions are named as p0, p1, ..., and pn.

* If HASH or KEY is used as the subpartitioning strategy, the subpartitions are named as sp0, sp1, ..., and spn.

For a template-based subpartitioned table, after you define subpartitions, the system names the subpartitions in the `($part_name)s($subpart_name)` format. For a non-template-based subpartitioned table, the subpartitions are named by yourself.

## Functions supported by partitioning expressions

You can specify an expression as a partitioning key for Range, List, and Hash partitioning. MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database support only the following functions in partitioning expressions:
