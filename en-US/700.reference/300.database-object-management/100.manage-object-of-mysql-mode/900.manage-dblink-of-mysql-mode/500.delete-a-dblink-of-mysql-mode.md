# Drop a DBLink

You can drop a DBLink that is no longer required.

## Procedure

The syntax for dropping a DBLink is as follows:

```sql
DROP DATABASE LINK [IF EXISTS] dblink_name;
```

Note that:

* To execute this statement, you must have the `DROP DATABASE LINK` privilege. For information about how to grant user privileges, see [Grant direct privileges](../../../../600.manage/500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/200.permission-of-mysql-mode/200.authority-of-mysql-mode.md).

* If `IF EXISTS` is specified, the system does not return an error even if the DBLink to be dropped does not exist. If `IF EXISTS` is not specified and the DBLink to be dropped does not exist, the system returns an error.

* Here, `dblink_name` specifies the name of the DBLink to be dropped.

Here is an example:

```sql
DROP DATABASE LINK IF EXISTS ob_dblink;
```
