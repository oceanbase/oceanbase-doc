# Define an auto-increment column

If you want the values of a numeric column to automatically increment when you create a table, you can define an auto-increment column. You can set the column type to `AUTO_INCREMENT` under a MySQL tenant.

## About auto-increment columns

### Attributes of an auto-increment column

To define an auto-increment column, you must set three tenant variables that respectively specify the start value, the increment step, and the cache size of the auto-increment column.

| Variable | Description |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| auto_increment_cache_size | The cache size. Value range: \[1, 100000000\]. Default value: `1000000`. This variable takes effect globally.  |
| auto_increment_increment | The increment step. Value range: \[1, 65535\]. Default value: `1`. This variable takes effect at the session level.  |
| auto_increment_offset | The start value of the `AUTO_INCREMENT` column. Value range: \[1, 65535\]. Default value: `1`. This variable takes effect at the session level.  |

### Value hopping of auto-increment columns

In MySQL Database, auto-increment columns are a column attribute in database tables. An auto-increment column can automatically generate unique incremental values to uniquely identify the data of the corresponding rows. OceanBase Database is a distributed database in which database tables are generally distributed across multiple different servers. OceanBase Database must ensure auto-increment column generation performance in distributed multi-server scenarios while ensuring compatibility with MySQL Database. This result in the issue of value hopping when auto-increment values are generated.

OceanBase Database supports two auto-increment modes for auto-increment columns: NOORDER and ORDER. The default mode is ORDER. The two auto-increment modes are described as follows:

* ORDER: This mode is implemented based on the centralized cache. In this mode, values in the auto-increment column increment globally.

* NOORDER: This mode is implemented based on the distributed cache. In this mode, values in the auto-increment column are globally unique.

The following sections describe how auto-increment values hop during generation in the two modes.

#### NOORDER mode

Tables created by specifying `AUTO_INCREMENT_MODE = 'NOORDER'` in OceanBase Database V4.x and all tables that contain auto-increment columns in OceanBase Database of a version earlier than V4.0.0 are in NOORDER mode.

The following figure shows the working principle of an auto-increment column in NOORDER mode.

![NOORDER mode](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/EN_US/7.reference/300.database-object-management/Noorder.png)

As shown in the preceding figure, the data structure of an auto-increment column in NOORDER mode consists of two parts:

* Internal table: persists the checkpoint of auto-increment values that have been used.

* Cache: records, in the internal structure, an auto-increment value range that is requested from the internal table.

For an auto-increment column in NOORDER mode, OBServer nodes are independent of each other. Each OBServer node can obtain an auto-increment value range from the internal table and record the range in the server cache to accelerate the generation of auto-increment values. The following typical scenarios demonstrate why auto-increment values hop in NOORDER mode.

**Scenario 1: Auto-increment values are generated for multiple partitions on multiple servers**

Assume that `auto_increment_cache_size` is set to `100`. When OBServer 1, OBServer 2, and OBServer 3 where a partitioned table is distributed receive an `insert into values (null)` request in order, the internal processing logic is as follows:

1. When OBServer 1 finds that it has no value range cached, it requests an auto-increment value range [1,100] from the internal table and generates an auto-increment value `1`.

2. When OBServer 2 finds that it has no value range cached, it requests an auto-increment value range [101,200] from the internal table and generates an auto-increment value `101`.

3. When OBServer 3 finds that it has no value range cached, it requests an auto-increment value range [201,300] from the internal table and generates an auto-increment value `201`.

4. OBServer 1 generates auto-increment value `2` based on the cached value range [2,100].

5. OBServer 2 generates auto-increment value `102` based on the cached value range [102,200].

   …

This way, values `1, 101, 201, 2, 102, ...` are inserted into the table in order, resulting in value hopping.

**Scenario 2: The `INSERT` statement is used to insert a specified maximum value**

In MySQL Database, if a specified value is explicitly inserted into the auto-increment column of a table, the auto-increment values generated later will not be smaller than this value.

In a distributed scenario of OceanBase Database, when an OBServer node learns that a maximum value is inserted, it must synchronize the information to other OBServer nodes and the internal table. The synchronization operation is time-consuming. To avoid synchronization each time when a specified maximum value is inserted, the system will abandon the current value range when a maximum value is inserted. This way, no synchronization is required until the next cached value.

Assume that OBServer 1, OBServer 2, and OBServer 3 where a partitioned table is distributed receive a request to explicitly specify an incremental sequence (`1, 2, 3, ...`) in order, and each of the servers caches a value range.

1. OBServer 1 receives the value `1`. Then, OBServer 1 abandons the cached value range [1,100], requests a new value range [301,400] from the internal table, and synchronizes the value `101` to the internal table and other OBServer nodes.

2. OBServer 2 receives the value `2`. OBServer 2 compares the received value with the cached value range [101,200] and does not take any action because the received value is smaller than the smallest value of the value range.

3. OBServer 3 receives the value `3`. OBServer 3 compares the received value with the cached value range [201,300] and does not take any action because the received value is smaller than the smallest value of the value range.

4. OBServer 1 receives the value `4`. OBServer 1 compares the received value with the cached value range [301,400] and does not take any action because the received value is smaller than the smallest value of the value range.
   ...

This way, if the auto-increment column is still used to generate a sequence after some values are inserted, hopping of auto-increment values will occur. For example, the first value range [1,100] of OBServer 1 is not used. The start value of the new value range directly hops to `301`.

Besides a multi-server environment, hopping of auto-increment values also occurs in a single-server environment when a specified maximum value is inserted. Here is an example:

1. Create a table named `t1` that contains an auto-increment column.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 int not null auto_increment) AUTO_INCREMENT_MODE='NOORDER';
   ```

   Set `auto_increment_cache_size` to `100`.

2. Insert data into the table multiple times.

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null);
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(3);
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(null);
   ```

3. View the data in the table.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----+
   | c1  |
   +-----+
   |   1 |
   |   3 |
   | 101 |
   +-----+
   ```

   The query result shows that the value in the auto-increment column hops from 3 to 101.

**Scenario 3: A server is restarted or breaks down**

The cache of an auto-increment column is a memory structure. If an OBServer node is restarted or breaks down, the unused values in the value range cached on the OBServer node will not be written back to the internal table and will no longer be used. For example, assume that the initial auto-increment value range cached on OBServer 1 is [1,100] and auto-increment values 1 and 2 have been generated. If OBServer 1 breaks down and is restarted, the value range cached on this server changes to [101,200] and the next auto-increment value is 101. As a result, the auto-increment values are `1, 2, 101, ...`, resulting in value hopping.

#### ORDER mode

To avoid the issue of auto-increment value hopping in NOORDER mode in common scenarios where auto-increment values are generated for multiple partitions on multiple servers or the `INSERT` statement is used to insert a specified maximum value, OceanBase Database supports auto-increment columns in ORDER mode since V4.x. ORDER is the default mode for tables and has better compatibility with MySQL Database.

The following figure shows the working principle of an auto-increment column in ORDER mode.

![ORDER mode](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/EN_US/7.reference/300.database-object-management/Order.png)

In ORDER mode, an auto-increment column will select the OBServer node which is the leader of the current cluster to provide services. Other OBServer nodes that serve as followers must send a remote procedure call (RPC) request to apply for auto-increment values from the leader. The leader will request an auto-increment value range from the internal table and cache the value range.

For example, assume that `auto_increment_cache_size` is set to `100` in a scenario where auto-increment values are generated for multiple partitions on multiple servers. When OBServer 1, OBServer 2, OBServer 3 where a partitioned table is distributed receive an `insert into values (null)` request in order, the internal processing logic is as follows:

1. OBServer 1 finds that it is not the leader and therefore sends an RPC request to OBServer 2. OBServer 2 requests an auto-increment value range [1,100] from the internal table and returns an auto-increment value `1` to OBServer 1.

2. OBServer 2 finds that it is the leader and has cached a value range [2,100]. Therefore, OBServer 2 directly generates an auto-increment value `2`.

3. OBServer 3 finds that it is not the leader and therefore sends an RPC request to OBServer 2. OBServer 2 finds that it has cached a value range [3,100] and then returns an auto-increment value `3` to OBServer 3.

   …

In ORDER mode, all OBServer nodes that serve as followers request auto-increment values from the leader, and the system can always generate continuous auto-increment values, which is the same as a single-server scenario. However, the ORDER mode has poorer performance than the NOORDER mode in a high-concurrency multi-server scenario.

For auto-increment columns in ORDER mode, the issue of auto-increment value hopping is resolved in scenarios where auto-increment columns are generated for multiple partitions on multiple servers or the `INSERT` statement is used to insert a specified maximum value. However, the issue still occurs in scenarios where the OBServer node that serves as the leader is restarted or breaks down or leader switching occurs.

**Scenario 1: The leader is restarted or breaks down**

In ORDER mode, the OBServer node that serves as the leader saves the value ranges cached in the memory. When the OBServer node that serves as the leader is restarted or breaks down, the unused auto-increment values in the current value range will no longer be used, and a new value range is used. As a result, auto-increment value hopping occurs.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>In this scenario, auto-increment value hopping occurs only when the OBServer node that serves as the leader is restarted or breaks down. Other OBServer nodes that serve as followers do not save value ranges. Therefore, the generation of continuous auto-increment values is not affected by the breakdown of followers. </p>
</main>

**Scenario 2: Leader switching occurs**

Assume that the initial auto-increment value range cached on OBServer 2 is [1,100] and auto-increment values 1 and 2 have been generated. When leader switching occurs in the cluster, the general processing logic is as follows:

1. If OBServer 1 becomes the new leader, OBServer 1 requests a new auto-increment value range [101,200] from the internal table and generates auto-increment values `101` and `102`.

2. After OBServer 2 is restarted, it becomes the leader again. OBServer 2 continues to use the original cached value range [3,100] and generates auto-increment values 3 and 4.

Generated auto-increment values 101 and 3 are not incremental.

To avoid the preceding situation where auto-increment values are not incremental, OceanBase Database will clear the value range cached on the original leader when leader switching occurs. This results in auto-increment value hopping.

## Create an auto-increment column

If you specified an auto-increment column when you created a table, when you use the `INSERT` statement to insert records into the table, you do not need to specify a value for the auto-increment column. OceanBase Database automatically assigns values to it.

Assume that a value of the auto-increment column is specified in the `INSERT` statement and `SQL_MODE` is not set to `NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO`. If this value is `0` or is greater than the current maximum value, OceanBase Database automatically assigns the next value of the auto-increment column to the column to be inserted. If this value is smaller than the current maximum value, the calculation of the next value of the auto-increment column is not affected.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If <code>SQL_MODE</code> is set to <code>NO_AUTO_VALUE_ON_ZERO</code>, no column is set as an auto-increment column when the value specified in the <code>INSERT</code> statement is <code>0</code>. </p>
  </main>

### Create a table named t1 and specify a column constraint

```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1(id bigint not null auto_increment primary key, name varchar(50), gmt_create timestamp not null default current_timestamp);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> INSERT INTO t1(name) VALUES('A'),('B'),('C');
Query OK, 3 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+----+------+---------------------+
| id | name | gmt_create          |
+----+------+---------------------+
|  1 | A    | 2020-04-03 17:09:55 |
|  2 | B    | 2020-04-03 17:09:55 |
|  3 | C    | 2020-04-03 17:09:55 |
+----+------+---------------------+
3 rows in set
```

This example involves the following settings:

* The data type of the `id` column is set to `bigint`.

* `NOT NULL` constraint: requires that the constrained column do not contain `NULL` values.

* `auto_increment`: sets the column as an auto-increment column. You can set only non-`BOOL/BOOLEAN` integer columns as auto-increment columns.

* `primary key`: sets the `id` column as the primary key column.

* `name varchar(50)`: specifies that the data type of the `name` column is `varchar` and the maximum character length of the column is `50`.

* Since the `id` column is set as an auto-increment column, when you use the `INSERT` statement to insert data records into the table, you do not need to specify a value for the auto-increment column. OceanBase Database automatically assigns values to the column.

### Insert a data record into the t1 table and set the value of the auto-increment column to 0

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO t1(id, name) VALUES(0, 'D');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+----+------+---------------------+
| id | name | gmt_create          |
+----+------+---------------------+
|  1 | A    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  2 | B    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  3 | C    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  4 | D    | 2021-12-17 14:22:36 |
+----+------+---------------------+
```

In the example, the value `0` is specified for the auto-increment column in the `INSERT` statement. In this case, OceanBase Database automatically assigns the next value of the auto-increment column to the column to be inserted.

### Insert a data record into the t1 table and set the value of the auto-increment column to -1

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO t1(id, name) VALUES(-1,'E');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+----+------+---------------------+
| id | name | gmt_create          |
+----+------+---------------------+
| -1 | E    | 2021-12-17 15:25:04 |
|  1 | A    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  2 | B    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  3 | C    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  4 | D    | 2021-12-17 14:22:36 |
+----+------+---------------------+
5 rows in set
```

In the example, because `-1` is smaller than the current maximum value of the auto-increment column, the calculation of the next value of the auto-increment column is not affected.

### Insert a data record into the t1 table and set the value of the auto-increment column to 10

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO t1(id, name) VALUES(10,'F');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+----+------+---------------------+
| id | name | gmt_create          |
+----+------+---------------------+
| -1 | E    | 2021-12-17 15:25:04 |
|  1 | A    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  2 | B    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  3 | C    | 2021-12-17 14:21:53 |
|  4 | D    | 2021-12-17 14:22:36 |
| 10 | F    | 2021-12-17 15:33:28 |
+----+------+---------------------+
6 rows in set
```

`10` is greater than the current maximum value of the auto-increment column, and is therefore directly used as the value of the `id` column. If you insert a data record `G` into the `name` column, OceanBase Database automatically assigns the value of the auto-increment column, namely the `id` column.

The query result is as follows:

```sql
obclient> INSERT INTO t1(name) VALUES('G');
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t1;
+---------+------+---------------------+
| id      | name | gmt_create          |
+---------+------+---------------------+
|      -1 | E    | 2020-04-03 17:10:24 |
|       1 | A    | 2020-04-03 17:09:55 |
|       2 | B    | 2020-04-03 17:09:55 |
|       3 | C    | 2020-04-03 17:09:55 |
|       4 | D    | 2020-04-03 17:10:19 |
|      10 | F    | 2020-04-03 17:10:29 |
|      11 | G    | 2020-04-03 17:10:34 |
+---------+------+---------------------+
7 rows in set
```

## Change a normal column to an auto-increment column

After you create a table, you can change a normal column in the table to an auto-increment column.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TABLE table_name MODIFY column_name data_type AUTO_INCREMENT;
```

where

* `table_name` specifies the name of the table to be modified.

* `column_name` specifies the name of the column to be changed to an auto-increment column.

* `data_type` specifies the data type of the column to be modified.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>When you change a column to an auto-increment column, you can modify the data type of the column. Make sure that the new data type supports auto increment. </p>
  </main>

   For more information about data types, see [Data types](../../../500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/200.common-tenant-of-mysql-mode/100.basic-elements-of-mysql-mode/100.data-type-of-mysql-mode/100.data-type-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

Here is an example:

1. Create a table named `tbl1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl1(id bigint(10));
   ```

2. Change a column of the `tbl1` table to an auto-increment column.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER TABLE tbl1 MODIFY id bigint(10) AUTO_INCREMENT;
   ```

## Specify and modify the mode of an auto-increment column

When you create a table, you can use the `AUTO_INCRENENT_MODE` parameter to specify the auto-increment mode of an auto-increment column in the table. You can also modify the mode after you create the table. Alternatively, you can use the `default_auto_increment_mode` parameter to specify a default auto-increment mode for auto-increment columns in tables of a specific tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If you do not specify the auto-increment mode when you create a table, the system uses the auto-increment mode specified by the <code>default_auto_increment_mode</code> parameter for the table. The default value of the parameter is <code>ORDER</code>. </p>
  </main>

Here is an example:

* Specify the auto-increment mode when you create a table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl2(id bigint(10) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(50)) AUTO_INCREMENT_MODE='NOORDER';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl2\G

   ) AUTO_INCREMENT = 1 AUTO_INCREMENT_MODE = 'NOORDER' DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4 ROW_FORMAT = DYNAMIC COMPRESSION = 'zstd_1.3.8' REPLICA_NUM = 1 BLOCK_SIZE = 16384 USE_BLOOM_FILTER = FALSE TABLET_SIZE = 134217728 PCTFREE = 0
   1 row in set
   ```

* After you create a table, modify the auto-increment mode of an auto-increment column in the table.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl2(id bigint(10) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(50));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> SHOW CREATE TABLE tbl2\G

   1 row in set
   ```

* Specify a default auto-increment mode for auto-increment columns in tables of a specific tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET default_auto_increment_mode = 'ORDER';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient> CREATE TABLE tbl3(id bigint(10) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(50));

         Table: tbl3
   Create Table: CREATE TABLE `tbl3` (

   ) AUTO_INCREMENT = 1 AUTO_INCREMENT_MODE = 'ORDER' DEFAULT CHARSET = utf8mb4 ROW_FORMAT = DYNAMIC COMPRESSION = 'zstd_1.3.8' REPLICA_NUM = 1 BLOCK_SIZE = 16384 USE_BLOOM_FILTER = FALSE TABLET_SIZE = 134217728 PCTFREE = 0
   1 row in set
   ```
