# Drop a trigger

You can execute the `DROP TRIGGER` statement to drop a trigger.

Before you drop a trigger, make sure that you have privileges on the associated table of this trigger. If you drop a table, the trigger associated with this table is also dropped.

The syntax for dropping a trigger is as follows:

```sql
obclient> DROP TRIGGER [IF EXISTS] [database_name.]trigger_name;
```

where

* `IF EXISTS` indicates that if the specified trigger exists, the system drops the trigger.

* `database_name` specifies the database name. This is an optional parameter. If no database is specified, the trigger is dropped from the current database.

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP TRIGGER test.test_trg;
```
