# LOAD DATA

## Purpose

You can use this statement to import data from an external file.

In OceanBase Database, you can use this statement to load only local files from OBServer nodes. Therefore, you must copy a file to an OBServer node before you import it.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
 <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The current version of OceanBase Database does not support the <code>LOCAL INFILE</code> statement. </p>
</main>

You can use the `LOAD DATA` statement to import a CSV text file in the following process:

1. Parse the file: OceanBase Database reads data from a file based on the file name that you enter and determines whether to perform parallel or serial parsing of data from the input file based on the specified degree of parallelism.

2. Distribute the data: OceanBase Database is a distributed database. Data of each partition may be distributed across different OBServer nodes. The `LOAD DATA` statement is used to process the parsed data and determine to which Observer node the data is sent.

3. Insert the data: After the destination OBServer node receives the data, it executes the `INSERT` statement to insert the data into the corresponding partition.

To import data from an external file, you must have the `FILE` privilege.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>If the <code>REPLACE</code> or <code>IGNORE</code> clause is used and the degree of parallelism is greater than <code>1</code>, the finally inserted records of conflicting rows may differ from the results of serial execution. If you want to strictly guarantee the insertion of conflicting records, do not specify the degree of parallelism for the statement (or set the degree of parallelism to <code>1</code>). </p>
  </main>

## Syntax

```sql
LOAD DATA
    [/*+ PARALLEL(N) load_batch_size(M) APPEND */]
   |[/*+ PARALLEL(N) direct(bool, int) */]
    INFILE 'file_name'
    [REPLACE | IGNORE]
    INTO TABLE table_name
    [{FIELDS | COLUMNS}
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
        [[OPTIONALLY] ENCLOSED BY 'char']
        [ESCAPED BY 'char']
    ]
    [LINES
        [STARTING BY 'string']
        [TERMINATED BY 'string']
    ]
    [IGNORE number {LINES | ROWS}]
    [(column_name_var
        [, column_name_var] ...)]
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| parallel(N) | The degree of parallelism for loading data. The default value of `N` is `4`.  |
| load_batch_size(M) | The batch size of each insertion. The default value of `M` is `1000`. Recommended value range: [100, 1000].  |
| APPEND | A hint for enabling the bypass import feature. This feature allows you to allocate space and write data to data files. By default, this hint is equivalent to `direct(false, 0)` and can collect statistics online like the `GATHER_OPTIMIZER_STATISTICS` hint.  |
| direct | A hint for enabling the bypass import feature. The `bool` parameter in `direct(bool, int)` specifies whether the given CSV file is ordered. The value `true` indicates that the file is ordered, and in this case, internal sorting is not required; otherwise, internal sorting is required. The `int` parameter specifies the maximum number of error rows allowed. |
| file_name | The path and name of the input file. Currently, you can load only local files from OBServer nodes.  |
| REPLACE \| IGNORE | If a unique key conflict occurs, `REPLACE` indicates that conflicting rows are overwritten, and `IGNORE` indicates that conflicting rows are ignored.  The `LOAD DATA` statement checks whether a table contains duplicate data based on its primary key. If the table does not have a primary key, the `REPLACE` and `IGNORE` options are equivalent. If duplicate data exists, the `LOAD DATA` statement records the incorrect data to a log file by default.  |
| table_name | The name of the table from which data is imported. Partitioned and non-partitioned tables are supported.  |
| FIELDS \| COLUMNS | The format of the field.  <ul><li> `ENCLOSED BY`: specifies the modifier of the exported value.   </li> <li> `TERMINATED BY`: specifies the end character of the exported column.  </li> <li>`ESCAPED BY` specifies the characters ignored for the exported value. </li></ul> |
| LINES STARTING BY | The start character of the line.  |
| LINES TERMINATED BY | The end character of the line.  |
| IGNORE number { LINES \| ROWS } | Specifies to ignore the first few lines. `LINES` indicates the first few lines of the file. `ROWS` indicates the first few rows of data specified by the field delimiter.  By default, fields in the input file are mapped to columns in the destination table one by one.  If the input file does not contain all the columns, the missing columns are filled based on the following mappings: * Character type: null string.    <ul><li> Numeric data type: 0     </li> <li> Date data type: `0000-00-00` </li></ul> |
| column_name_var | The name of the imported column.  |

## Examples

Example 1: Import data from an external file.

1. Set a global security path.

   ```shell
   obclient> SET GLOBAL secure_file_priv = ""
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   obclinet> \q
   Bye
   ```

2. Import data from an external file.

   ```shell
   obclient> LOAD DATA INFILE 'test.sql' INTO TABLE t1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

Example 2: Use the `APPEND` hint to enable the bypass import feature.

```shell
LOAD DATA /*+ PARALLEL(4) APPEND */
   INFILE '/home/admin/a.csv'
   INTO TABLE t;
```

Example 3: Use the `direct(bool, int)` hint to enable the bypass import feature. The file to be imported in bypass mode can be stored in OSS.

```shell
load data /*+ parallel(1) direct(false,0)*/ remote_oss infile 'oss://antsys-oceanbasebackup/backup_rd/xiaotao.ht/lineitem2.tbl?host=***.oss-cdn.***&access_id=***&access_key=***' into table lineitem fields terminated by '|' enclosed by '' lines starting by '' terminated by '\n';
```
