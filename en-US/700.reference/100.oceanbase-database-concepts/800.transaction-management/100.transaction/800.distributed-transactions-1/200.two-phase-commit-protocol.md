# Two-phase commit
#docslug#/oceanbase-database/oceanbase-database/V4.0.0/two-phase-commit-protocol
OceanBase Database implements the native two-phase commit protocol to ensure the atomicity of distributed transactions.

The two-phase commit protocol involves two roles: coordinator and participant. The coordinator advances the entire protocol to facilitate consensus between participants. Participants complete operations like prepare, commit, and rollback as requested by the coordinator.

## Commit process of a distributed transaction

The following figure shows the two-phase commit process for traditional databases and OceanBase Database.

### Prepare phase

The coordinator sends a prepare request to each participant.

After receiving the prepare request, each participant determines whether a transaction can be committed. If the transaction can be committed, the participant persists the prepare logs and returns a prepare success response to the coordinator. If the transaction cannot be committed, the participant returns a prepare failure response to the coordinator.

### Commit phase

After receiving prepare ACK signals from all participants, the coordinator enters the COMMIT state and returns a commit success response to the user. Then, the coordinator sends a commit request to each participant.

After receiving the commit request, each participant releases resources, unlocks rows, and then submits commit logs. After the logs are persisted, the participant returns the `commit ok` message to the coordinator, releases the transaction context, and then exits.
