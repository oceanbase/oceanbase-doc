# Backup directory structures

## Structure of log archive directories

You can specify the time interval for splitting log archive directories. By default, the directories are split by day. In other words, the log data directory of one day corresponds to a backup_piece.

When you use Network File System (NFS), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), or Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) as the backup media, the structure of log archive directories is as follows:

```javascript
log_archive_dest
    ├── check_file
    │   └── 1002_connect_file_20230111T193049.obbak // The connectivity check file.
    ├── format.obbak                                // The format information of the backup path.
    ├── rounds                                      // The round placeholder directory.
    │   └── round_d1002r1_start.obarc               // The round start placeholder.
    ├── pieces                                      // The piece placeholder directory.
    │   ├── piece_d1002r1p1_start_20230111T193049.obarc // The piece start placeholder, in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID_start_DATE.
    │   └── piece_d1002r1p1_end_20230111T193249.obarc   // The piece end placeholder, in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID_end_DATE.
    └── piece_d1002r1p1                             // The piece directory, named in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID.       
        ├── piece_d1002r1p1_20230111T193049_20230111T193249.obarc // The contiguous interval of a piece.
        ├── checkpoint   
        │   └── checkpoint_info.0.obarc             // The archiving progress of a piece that is being archived.
        ├── single_piece_info.obarc                 // The metadata of the piece.
        ├── tenant_archive_piece_infos.obarc        // The metadata of all frozen pieces before this piece.        
        ├── file_info.obarc                         // The list of files in all log streams.
        ├── logstream_1                             // Log stream 1.
        │   ├── file_info.obarc                    // The list of files in log stream 1.
        │   ├── log
        │   │   └── 1.obarc                         // The archive file in log stream 1.  
        │   └── schema_meta                         // The metadata of data dictionaries. This file is generated only in log stream 1.
        │       └── 1677588501408765915.obarc                           
        └── logstream_1001                          // Log stream 1001.
            ├── file_info.obarc                      // The list of files in log stream 1001.
            └── log
                └── 1.obarc                          // The archive file in log stream 1001.    
```

In the above directory structure, the top-level directory contains the following types of data:

* `format.obbak`: Records the metadata of the archive path, including the tenant that uses the path.

* `check_file`: Checks the connectivity to the root archive directory.

* `rounds`: The summary directory that records all rounds of log archiving.

* `pieces`: The summary directory that records all pieces of log archiving.

* `piece_d1002r1p1`: The piece directory for log archiving, which is named in the format of `piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID`. Here, `DESTID` refers to the ID corresponding to `log_archive_dest`, `ROUNDID` refers to the ID of the log archiving round, which is a monotonically increasing integer, and `PIECEID` refers to the ID of the log archiving piece, which is also a monotonically increasing integer.

  In a log archiving piece directory, the following data is included:

   * `piece_d1002r1p1_20230111T193049_20230111T193249.obarc`: This file displays the ID, start time, and end time of the current piece and is used only for display purposes.

   * `checkpoint`: This directory is used to record the archiving timestamps of active pieces. The ObArchiveScheduler module periodically updates the timestamp information in this directory.

   * `single_piece_info.obarc`: This file records the metadata of the current piece.

   * `tenant_archive_piece_infos.obarc`: This file records the metadata of all frozen pieces in the current tenant.

   * `file_info.obarc`: This file records the list of log streams within the piece.

   * `logstream_1`: This directory records the log files of log stream 1, which is the system log stream of an OceanBase Database tenant.

   * `logstream_1001`: This directory records the log files of log stream 1001, where log streams with numbers greater than 1000 are user log streams of an OceanBase Database tenant.

   Additionally, each log stream backup contains three types of data:

   * `file_info.obarc`: This file records the list of files in the log stream.

   * `log`: This directory contains all the archive files of the current log stream, with file names consistent with those in the source cluster.

   * `schema_meta`: This directory records the metadata of data dictionaries. It is only present in the system log stream but not in user log streams.

When you use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as the backup media, the structure of log archive directories is different from that in other media. An archive file consists of multiple small files and the corresponding metadata file. The specific directory structure is as follows.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Despite the difference in directory structure, backup files copied from S3 to other backup media across clouds can still be used for restore. For example, if you copy archived data from S3 to OSS, you can successfully restore data from the OSS path. </p>
</main>

```javascript

        ├── ......                         					// The list of files in all log streams.

        |		|		    └── ......  
        |		|		    └── @APD_PART@FORMAT_META.obarc // The format of the archive file.
        |		|		    └── @APD_PART@SEAL_META.obarc   // The metadata of the archive file.      
        │   └── schema_meta                         // The metadata of the data dictionary. This file is generated only in log stream 1.
        │       └── 1677588501408765915.obarc                           
        └── logstream_1001                          // Log stream 1001.
            ├── file_info.obarc                      // The list of files in log stream 1001.
            └── log
                └── 1.obarc                          // The archive file in log stream 1001.      
```

In the above directory structure, `1.obarc` indicates a single archive file that is identified by a prefix. The prefix and the name of the archive file are the same. An archive file contains the following three types of data:

* `@APD_PART@FORMAT_META.obarc`: When data is written to the archive file for the first time, the `format_meta` file is generated in this directory to record the format of the archive file.

* `@APD_PART@0-32472973.obarc`: The actual data in the archive file is written to the file named with this prefix, and the start offset and the end offset of each write are recorded in the file name.

* `@APD_PART@SEAL_META.obarc`: After data is written to the archive file for the last time, the `seal_meta` file is generated in this directory to record the metadata in the archive file.

## Structure of data backup directories

Each data backup corresponds to a backup_set directory. Each time the `ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP DATABASE` statement is executed, a new backup_set directory is generated, containing all data that is backed up this time.

The structure of data backup directories is as follows:

```javascript
data_backup_dest
├── format.obbak                                            // The format information of the backup path.

```

In the backup directory structure, the top-level directory contains the following types of data:


* `format.obbak`: Records the metadata of the backup path.

* `check_file`: Checks the connectivity to the root backup directory.

* `backup_sets`: The summary directory that contains all data backup sets.

* `backup_set_1_full`: This directory represents a data backup set, where a directory whose name ends with `full` is a full backup set, and a directory whose name ends with `inc` is an incremental backup set. Each data backup generates a corresponding backup set, and the backup set will not be modified after the data backup is completed.

  In a data backup set, the following data is included:

   * `backup_set_1_full_20230111T193330_20230111T193420.obbak`: This file records the ID, start time, and end time of the current backup set. This file is used only for display purposes.

   * `single_backup_set_info.obbak`: This file records the metadata of the current backup set, including the backup timestamp, dependent logs, and other information.

   * `tenant_backup_set_infos.obbak`: This file records the metadata of all existing backup sets for the current tenant.

   * `infos`: This directory records the metadata of the data backup set.

   * `logstream_1`: This directory records all the data of log stream 1, which is the system log stream of an OceanBase Database tenant.

   * `logstream_1001`: This directory records all the data of log stream 1001, where log streams with numbers greater than 1000 are user log streams of an OceanBase Database tenant.

   In addition, each log stream backup has four types of directories. Directories whose names contain `retry` record information about log stream-level retries, and directories whose names contain `turn` record information about tenant-level retries.

   * `meta_info_xx`: This directory records log stream metadata and tablet metadata.
   * `sys_data_xx`: This directory records the data of internal system tablets in log streams.
   * `minor_data_xx`: This directory records the minor-compacted data of regular tablets.
   * `major_data_xx`: This directory records the baseline data of regular tablets.
