# NOT NULL constraints

In OceanBase Database, a `NOT NULL` constraint is used to ensure that a specified column of a table is never assigned a `NULL` value.

The syntax is as follows:

```sql
column_name data_type NOT NULL;
```

If a `NOT NULL` constraint is defined on a column, you cannot insert a `NULL` value into or update an existing value to `NULL` in the column.

To be more exact, a `NOT NULL` constraint on a column is actually an attribute of the column because you cannot find information about `NOT NULL` constraints among the constraint-related tables in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`, such as the `CHECK_CONSTRAINTS`, `REFERENTIAL_CONSTRAINTS`, `TABLE_CONSTRAINTS`, and `TABLE_CONSTRAINTS_EXTENSIONS` tables.
