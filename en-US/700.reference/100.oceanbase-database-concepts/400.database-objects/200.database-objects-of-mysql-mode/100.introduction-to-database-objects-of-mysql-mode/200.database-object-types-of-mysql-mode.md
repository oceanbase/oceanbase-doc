# Database object types

This topic describes the object types supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.

For more information, see the following table.


| Object type | Description |
|----------------------|----------|
| Table | The most basic storage unit in a database. A table is organized into rows and columns.  |
| View | A view is a virtual table whose elements are defined by a query. Like a true table, a view consists of a set of named columns and data rows. However, a view does not exist as a stored set of data values in a database. The rows and columns of data in a view come from tables referenced in the query that defines the view and are dynamically generated when the view is referenced.  |
| Index | An index sorts data of one or more columns. Indexes provide fast access to specified rows in a table. For example, you can search for information about an employee by last name based on the created index. An index helps you improve query efficiency.  |
| Partition | OceanBase Database can split the data of a table into different groups based on some rules. Data in the same group is stored in the same physical area. A table whose data is split into different groups is called a partitioned table. Tables in OceanBase Database are horizontally partitioned. Each partition contains some data rows. A table can be partitioned by specified partitioning methods such as hash partitioning, range partitioning, and list partitioning based on the mapping relationships between data and partitions. Each partition can be divided into several subpartitions from different dimensions. For example, you can partition the transaction table into several hash partitions based on the user IDs. Then, you can partition each hash partition into several range partitions based on the transaction time.  |
| Trigger | A trigger is a special stored procedure that is automatically called in response to a specific event. Unlike a regular stored procedure that is explicitly run, a trigger can be enabled and disabled but cannot be explicitly run.  |
| Stored program | A stored program is a set of SQL statements that are designed to perform specific tasks and stored in the database after compilation. You can call a stored program by specifying its name and parameters as needed. A stored program is a programmable function that consists of SQL statements and a control structure. A stored program can be created and saved in a database.  |
