# Datetime format models

Datetime format models specify the format of datetime data stored in the database.

The total length of a datetime format model cannot exceed 22 characters. If you need to convert a string value from a nondefault format to the datetime format, you can use datetime format models in functions.

Datetime format models can be used in the following functions:

* To convert a character value in a nondefault format to a datetime value, you need to use parameters of the functions `TO_DATE`, `TO_TIMESTAMP` and `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ` to specify the format of the datetime value.

* To convert a datetime value to a character value in a nondefault format, you need to use parameters of the `TO_CHAR` function to specify the format of the output string.

If no format is specified, the default format is used for conversion. You can explicitly specify the default datetime format by using the `NLS_DATE_FORMAT`, `NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT` or `NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT` system variable. You can query the values of these variables in the `V$NLS_PARAMETERS` system view or modify the values of these variables by using the `ALTER SESSION` or `ALTER SYSTEM` command.

## Datetime format elements

A datetime format model consists of one or more datetime format elements. For more information about the format elements supported by OceanBase Database, see **Table of datetime format elements**.

* If a datetime format is used to parse an input string, the same format element cannot appear twice. Format elements that represent similar information cannot be combined. For example, you cannot use both `SYYYY` and `BC` elements in the same datetime format. This rule is intended to prevent conflicts caused by information redundancy.

* Some elements cannot be used in the `TO_CHAR`, `TO_DATE`, `TO_TIMESTAMP`, and `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ` functions.

* Datetime format elements `FF`, `TZD`, `TZH`, `TZM`, and `TZR` can be used in timestamp and interval format models, but not in the `DATE` format model.

* Some elements generate fixed-length strings. If the length of a string is less than the specified length, blanks are added to the end of the string.

## Datetime format elements


| Element | Applicable to TO_\* functions | Description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -   /   , .  ;   :  "text" | Yes | A symbol string constant.  |
| AD  A.D. | Yes | The AD indicator, with or without periods.  |
| AM A.M. | Yes | The hours before noon, with or without periods.  |
| BC  B.C. | Yes | The BC indicator, with or without periods.  |
| CC SCC | No | The century.  |
| D | Yes | The day of a week. Value range: [1,7].  |
| DAY | Yes | The name of a day. The length of the result is fixed and is the same as the maximum length of the name.  |
| DD | Yes | The day of a month. Value range: [1,31].  |
| DDD | Yes | The day of a year. Value range: [1,366].  |
| DY | Yes | The abbreviated name of a day.  |
| FF \[1..9\] | Yes | The fractional seconds. Use digits 1 to 9 to specify the number of digits in the fractional second portion of the value returned, which is the precision.  Use the default precision specified for the datetime data type. It is valid in timestamp and interval formats, but not in `DATE`.  |
| HH | Yes | The hour of the day. Value range: [1,12].  |
| HH12 | No | The hour of the day in a 12-hour clock format. Valid values: 1 to 12. |
| HH24 | Yes | The hour of the day in a 24-hour clock format. Valid values: 0 to 23. |
| IW | No | The week of the year, based on the ISO standard. Valid values: 1 to 52 or 53.  |
| IYY IY I | No | The last three digits, two digits, or one digit of a year based on the ISO standard.  |
| IYYY | No | A 4-digit year based on the ISO standard.  |
| J | Yes | The Julian Day. |
| MI | Yes | The minute of an hour. Value range: [0,59].  |
| MM | Yes | The month of a year. Value range: [01,12]. 01 indicates January, and so forth.  |
| MON | Yes | The abbreviated name of a month.  |
| MONTH | Yes | The full name of a month. The length of the result is fixed and is the same as the maximum length of the name.  |
| PM  P.M. | No | The hours after noon, with or without periods.  |
| Q | No | The quarter. Value range: [1,4]. Quarter 1 is from January to March, and so on.  |
| RR | Yes | The last two digits of the year. The century depends on the two digits you enter and whether the current year is in the first or second half of the century. If the current year is in the first half of the century, the result is in the current century when you enter 00 to 49, and the result is in the last century when you enter 50 to 99. For example, if the current year is 2060, the result is in the next century when you enter 00 to 49, and the result is in the current century if you enter 55 to 99.  |
| RRRR | Yes | The year. You can enter two or four digits. If you enter two digits, the rule is the same as that of the RR element.  |
| SS | Yes | The seconds. Value range: [0,59].  |
| SSSSS | Yes | The seconds of the current day. Value range: [0,86400].  |
| TZD | Yes | The abbreviated time zone string that contains the daylight saving time information. For example, PST indicates US/Pacific Standard Time, and PDT indicates US/Pacific Daylight Saving Time. It is valid in timestamp and interval formats, but not in `DATE`.  |
| TZH | Yes | The hour part of the time zone. It is valid in timestamp and interval formats, but not in `DATE`.  |
| TZM | Yes | The minute part of the time zone. It is valid in timestamp and interval formats, but not in `DATE`.  |
| TZR | Yes | The region information of the time zone, such as US/Pacific. It is valid in timestamp and interval formats, but not in `DATE`.  |
| WW | No | The week of a year. Value range: [1,53].  |
| W | No | The week of a month. Value range: [1,5].  |
| X | Yes | The local delimiter used to delimit the fractional part. For example, you can use it like this: "HH:MI:SSXFF".  |
| Y,YYY | Yes | A year with a comma (,).  |
| YEAR SYEAR | No | A year with a detailed description.  |
| YYYY SYYYY | Yes | A 4-digit year. S prefixes BC dates with a minus sign (-).  |
| YYY YY Y | Yes | The last three digits, two digits, or one digit of a year.  |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>The datetime functions are <code>TO_CHAR</code>, <code>TO_DATE</code>, <code>TO_TIMESTAMP</code>, and <code>TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ</code>.
  </main>

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>The conversions in the table require matching between the dates in the input string and the format elements. Otherwise, an error is returned. </li>
    <li>The default date format for OceanBase Database is <strong>DD-MON-RR</strong>. You can execute <code>ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS';</code> to change the datetime format of the current session. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

If you omit some format elements, the system returns an error:

```sql
obclient> SELECT TO_DATE( '31 Aug 2020', 'DD MON YYY' ) FROM DUAL;
ORA-01830: date format picture ends before converting entire input string
```

### Uppercase letters in date format elements

The case of date format elements affects the case of the generated string. For example, `MONDAY` is generated based on `DAY`, `Monday` is generated based on `Day`, and `monday` is generated based on `day`. Here are some examples:

```sql
obclient> SELECT TO_CHAR(sysdate,'mon')  AS nowMonth FROM DUAL;
+----------+
| NOWMONTH |
+----------+
| mar      |
+----------+
1 row in set

obclient> SELECT TO_CHAR(sysdate,'MON')  AS nowMonth FROM DUAL;
+----------+
| NOWMONTH |
+----------+
| MAR      |
+----------+
1 row in set
```

## Punctuation and character literals in datetime format models

You can add the following characters to a datetime format model, which appear in the same positions in the response:

* Punctuation marks, such as hyphens (-), slashes (/), commas (,), periods (.), and colons (:)

* Character literals, which are enclosed in double quotation marks (")

OceanBase Database can flexibly convert strings into dates. When you use the `TO_DATE` function, if each numeric element in the input string contains the maximum allowed number of digits, the formatted string matches the input string.

### Examples

* **Example 1**: In the format element **MM/YY**, **02** corresponds to **MM**, and **07** corresponds to **YY**.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('0207','MM/YY'),'MM/YY') FROM DUAL;
   +------------------------------------------+
   | TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('0207','MM/YY'),'MM/YY') |
   +------------------------------------------+
   | 02/07                                    |
   +------------------------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

* **Example 2**: OceanBase Database allows matching between nonalphanumeric characters and punctuation marks in the format model, such as `#` for `/`.

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT TO_CHAR (TO_DATE('02#07','MM/YY'), 'MM/YY') FROM DUAL;
   +-------------------------------------------+
   | TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('02#07','MM/YY'),'MM/YY') |
   +-------------------------------------------+
   | 02/07                                     |
   +-------------------------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```
