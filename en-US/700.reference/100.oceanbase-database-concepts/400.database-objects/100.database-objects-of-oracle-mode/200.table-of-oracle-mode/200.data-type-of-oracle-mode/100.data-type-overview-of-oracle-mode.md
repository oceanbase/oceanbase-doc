# Overview

In an OceanBase database, each column in a table is assigned with a data type, and each data type has its own storage format, constraints, and value range. This topic describes the built-in data types that are most commonly used in OceanBase Database.

The following built-in data types are most commonly used in OceanBase Database:

* Character data types

* Numeric data types

* Datetime data types

* ROWID data types

* Multi-model data types

   * JSON data types
   * XML data types
   * Spatial data types

Other important data types include `RAW`, large object (LOB), and set. In procedural language (PL), you can also specify the `BOOLEAN`, reference, composite (including `COLLECTION` and `RECORD`), and other custom data types for constants and variables.

Data types associate a fixed set of attributes with data. The attributes enable OceanBase Database to process different types of data in different ways. For example, you can perform multiplications on `NUMBER` data but not `RAW` data.

When you create a table, you must specify a data type for each column in the table. Data inserted into the column must match the data type.
