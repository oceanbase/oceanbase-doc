# Database object storage

OceanBase Database stores the data of some database objects in one or more SSTables. An SSTable contains one or more macroblocks. Each macroblock contains one or more microblocks. Each microblock contains one or more rows. Some database objects, such as views, do not store actual data because they contain only metadata.

In contrast to conventional databases, OceanBase Database automatically manages tablespaces. You do not need to explicitly create or manage tablespaces. Some features, such as Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), support the syntax of tablespaces and allow you to set tablespace-related attributes.
