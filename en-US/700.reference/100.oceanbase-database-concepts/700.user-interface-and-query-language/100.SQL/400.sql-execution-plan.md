# Query SQL execution plans

An execution plan describes the process of executing an SQL statement in a database.

You can run the `EXPLAIN` command to view the logical execution plan generated by the optimizer for a given SQL statement. To analyze the performance of an SQL statement, you need to first check the SQL execution plan to see if any error exists. Therefore, understanding the execution plan is the first step for SQL tuning, and knowledge about operators of an execution plan is key to understanding the `EXPLAIN` command.

## Format of the EXPLAIN statement

OceanBase Database supports three `EXPLAIN` command formats: `EXPLAIN BASIC`, `EXPLAIN`, and `EXPLAIN EXTENDED`. They demonstrate details of execution plans at different levels:

* The `EXPLAIN BASIC` command shows the most basic framework of a plan.

* The `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` command extends a plan to its full frame with the most details and is usually used in troubleshooting.

* The `EXPLAIN` command shows information to the extent that helps users understand the entire execution process of a plan.

The format of the `EXPLAIN` command is as follows:

```sql
EXPLAIN [BASIC | EXTENDED | PARTITIONS | FORMAT = format_name] [PRETTY | PRETTY_COLOR] explainable_stmt
format_name:
  { TRADITIONAL | JSON }
explainable_stmt:
  { SELECT statement
 | DELETE statement
 | INSERT statement
 | REPLACE statement
 | UPDATE statement }
```
The `EXPLAIN` command applies to the `SELECT`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE`, and `UPDATE` statements. This command shows information about statement execution plans provided by the optimizer, including the method of processing the statement and the method and sequence of joining tables.

You can run the `EXPLAIN EXTENDED` command to display the scan range of the table and run the `EXPLAIN OUTLINE` command to display the outline information.

The `FORMAT` option is used to specify the output format. The `TRADITIONAL` value is the default value and specifies to display information in a table. The `JSON` value specifies to display information in a `JSON` file.

You can use the `EXPLAIN PARTITIONS` statement to check queries related to partitioned tables. If you check queries for non-partitioned tables, no error is returned, but the values in the `PARTITIONS` column are always `NULL`.

For complex execution plans, you can use the `PRETTY` or `PRETTY_COLOR` option to connect the parent and child nodes in the plan tree with tree lines or colored tree lines, so that the execution plan is easier to read. Here is an example:
```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE p1table(c1 INT ,c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 2;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE p2table(c1 INT ,c2 INT) PARTITION BY HASH(c1) PARTITIONS 4;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> EXPLAIN EXTENDED PRETTY_COLOR SELECT  * FROM p1table p1 JOIN p2table p2 ON p1.c1=p2.c2\G

## Shape and operators of a plan

A sample execution plan in OceanBase Database is as follows:

```sql
|ID|OPERATOR              |NAME       |EST. ROWS|COST |
-------------------------------------------------------
|0 |LIMIT                 |           |100      |81141|
|1 | TOP-N SORT           |           |100      |81127|
|2 |  HASH GROUP BY       |           |2924     |68551|
|3 |   HASH JOIN          |           |2924     |65004|
|4 |    SUBPLAN SCAN      |VIEW1      |2953     |19070|
|5 |     HASH GROUP BY    |           |2953     |18662|
|6 |      NESTED-LOOP JOIN|           |2953     |15080|
|7 |       TABLE SCAN     |ITEM       |19       |11841|
|8 |       TABLE SCAN     |STORE_SALES|161      |73   |
|9 |    TABLE SCAN        |DT         |6088     |29401|
=======================================================
```

You may notice from the foregoing examples that a plan in OceanBase Database is similar to that in Oracle Database. The following table describes columns of an execution plan in OceanBase Database.

| **Column** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------------------|
| ID | The sequence number of the execution tree obtained by using preorder traversal, starting from 0.  |
| OPERATOR | The name of the operator.  |
| NAME | The name of the table or index corresponding to a table operation.  |
| EST. ROWS | The estimated number of output rows of the operator.  |
| COST | The execution cost of the operator, in microseconds.  |


  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>In a table operation, the <code>NAME</code> field displays names (alias) of tables involved in the operation. In the case of index access, the name of the index is displayed in parentheses after the table name. For example, <code>t1(t1_c2)</code> indicates that index <code>t1_c2</code> is used. In the case of reverse scanning, the keyword <code>RESERVE</code> is added after the index name, with the index name and the keyword <code>RESERVE</code> separated with a comma (,), such as <code>t1(t1_c2,RESERVE)</code>. </p>
  </main>

In OceanBase Database, the first part of the output of the `EXPLAIN` command is the tree structure of the execution plan. The hierarchy of operations in the tree is represented by the indentation of the operators. Operators at the deepest level are executed first. Operators at the same level are executed in the specified execution order.

The following figure shows the tree structure of the execution plan described in the preceding example:

![Constraint 6](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer/V4.0.0/sql-execution-plan-1.png)

In OceanBase Database, the second part of the output of the `EXPLAIN` command contains the details of each operator, including the output expression, filter conditions, partition information, and unique information of each operator, such as the sort keys, join keys, and pushdown conditions. Here is an example:

```sql
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([t1.c1, ASC], [t1.c2, ASC]), prefix_pos(1)
  1 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2], [t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([t1.c1 = t2.c2]), other_conds(nil)
  2 - output([t2.c1], [t2.c2]), filter(nil), sort_keys([t2.c2, ASC])
  3 - output([t2.c2], [t2.c1]), filter(nil),
      access([t2.c2], [t2.c1]), partitions(p0)
  4 - output([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.c1], [t1.c2]), partitions(p0)
