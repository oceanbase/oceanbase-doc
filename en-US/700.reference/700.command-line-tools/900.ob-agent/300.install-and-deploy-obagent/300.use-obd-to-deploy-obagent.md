# Deploy OBAgent by using OBD

You can deploy OBAgent manually or by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD). To manually deploy OBAgent, you must configure OBAgent, Prometheus, and Prometheus Alertmanager (optional). We recommend that you use OBD to deploy OBAgent. This topic describes how to use OBD to deploy OBAgent. 

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy OBAgent, make sure that the default ports 8088 and 8089 are not occupied. You can also define custom ports. 

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If your server has access to the Internet, run the <code>obd cluster deploy</code> command. Then, OBD checks the server for the OBAgent installation package. If the package does not exist, OBD automatically obtains the package from the YUM repository. </p>
  </main>

## Deploy the OceanBase cluster and OBAgent

If you want to deploy the OceanBase cluster and OBAgent at the same time, add the following OBAgent configuration to the OceanBase Database configuration file:

```unknow
obagent:
  servers:
    - xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
  depends: 
    - oceanbase-ce
  global:
    home_path: /root/observer
```

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The <code>servers</code> field must match the <code>servers</code> field in oceanbase-ce. </p>
  </main>

For more information, see [Configuration file](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/blob/master/example/obagent/distributed-with-obproxy-and-obagent-example.yaml).

## Deploy OBAgent separately

OBD does not support adding new components to a deployed cluster. If you want to deploy OBAgent for an existing cluster, deploy OBAgent separately.

To deploy OBAgent separately, prepare the configuration file of OBAgent. Make sure that the following fields in the configuration file are the same as those in the OceanBase Database configuration file:

```unknow
obagent:
  global:
    # The username for HTTP authentication. Default value: admin.
    http_basic_auth_user: admin
    # The password for HTTP authentication.
    http_basic_auth_password: ****
    # The username for the debug service. Default value: admin.
    pprof_basic_auth_user: admin
    # The password for the debug service.
    pprof_basic_auth_password: ****

    # The following configurations must be consistent with those in the OceanBase cluster configuration file.
    # The monitor username for OceanBase Database. The user must have read access to OceanBase Database as a system tenant. Default value: root.
    monitor_user: root
    # The monitor password for OceanBase Database. By default, this field is empty. When a dependent component exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the component. The value is the same as the root_password in oceanbase-ce.
    monitor_password:
    # The SQL port for observer. The default value is 2881. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the mysql_port in oceanbase-ce.
    sql_port: 2881
    # The RPC port for observer. The default value is 2882. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the rpc_port in oceanbase-ce.
    rpc_port: 2882
    # Cluster name for OceanBase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the appname in oceanbase-ce.
    cluster_name: obcluster
    # Cluster ID for OceanBase Database. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the cluster_id in oceanbase-ce.
    cluster_id: 1
    # Zone name for your observer. The default value is zone1. When a depends exists, OBD gets this value from the oceanbase-ce of the depends. The value is the same as the zone name in oceanbase-ce.
    zone_name: zone1
    # Monitor status for OceanBase Database.  Active is to enable. Inactive is to disable. The default value is active. When you deploy a cluster automatically, OBD decides whether to enable this parameter based on depends.
```

For more information, see [OBAgent configuration file](https://github.com/oceanbase/obdeploy/blob/master/example/obagent/obagent-only-example.yaml). 

## Start OBAgent

Run the following commands to start OBAgent:

```unknow
# Pass in the configuration information.
obd cluster deploy <deploy name> [-c <yaml path>] [-f] [-U] [-A]
# Start OBAgent.
obd cluster start <deploy name> [flags]
```

For more information, see [Cluster commands](https://open.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-cn/V1.2.0/10000000000017241). 

## Start Prometheus (Optional)

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You must first install Prometheus. </p>
  </main>

OBD will replace the variables in the configuration file template of OBAgent. You can copy this configuration file (`prometheus.yaml`) to the host where Prometheus is deployed, and then run the following command to use the `prometheus.yaml` file to start Prometheus:

```unknow
./prometheus --config.file=./prometheus.yaml
```

## Deploy Prometheus Alertmanager (optional)

* Download and decompress the installation package of the Prometheus Alertmanager. 
* Start the Prometheus Alertmanager. 
* Configure Prometheus Alertmanager. For more information, see [Prometheus documentation](https://www.prometheus.io/docs/alerting/latest/configuration/). 

OBAgent provides default alert rules. The configuration files are located in `conf/prometheus_config/rules`. The `host_rules.yaml` file stores alert rules for the server, and the `ob_rules.yaml` file stores alert rules for OceanBase Database. If the default alert rules cannot meet your needs, you can customize the rules by using the following method:

```unknow
# To add custom alert rules to the Prometheus configuration file, you must place the configuration file in the conf/prometheus_config/rules directory and name it in the *rule.yaml format. 

groups:
- name: node-alert
    rules:
    - alert: disk-full
    expr: 100 - ((node_filesystem_avail_bytes{mountpoint="/",fstype=~"ext4|xfs"} * 100) / node_filesystem_size_bytes {mountpoint="/",fstype=~"ext4|xfs"}) > 80
    for: 1m
    labels:
        severity: page
    annotations:
        summary: "{{ $labels.instance }} disk full "
        description: "{{ $labels.instance }} disk > {{ $value }}  "
```

## Deploy and configure Grafana (Optional)

* Download and decompress the installation package of Grafana.
* Start Grafana.

   ```unknow
   ./bin/grafana-server
   ```

* Log on to Grafana and change the password.
* Configure Prometheus as the data source. For more information about how to add a data source, see the "[Add a data source](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v7.5/datasources/add-a-data-source/)" topic in Grafana documentation.
* Import the dashboard. The metric configurations for OceanBase Database and the server are published in Grafana, with the configuration IDs of `15215` and `15216`, respectively. For more information about how to import the dashboard, see the "[Export and import](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/v7.5/dashboards/export-import/)" topic in Grafana documentation.

## Update KV parameters (Optional)

To update the KV configuration, use `obd cluster edit-config`. For more information, see the `obd cluster edit-config` section in [Cluster commands](https://open.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-cn/V1.2.0/10000000000017241).
