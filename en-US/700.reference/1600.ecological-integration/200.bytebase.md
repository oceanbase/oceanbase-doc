# Manage OceanBase instances with Bytebase

Bytebase is an open-source database change management and collaboration tool that provides both SaaS services and a self-hosted version. This topic will use the OceanBase tenant of the MySQL mode as an example to demonstrate how to manage OceanBase instances using Bytebase.

## Prerequisites

1. Deploy Bytebase. For specific instructions, refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bytebase/bytebase).

2. Obtain the connection information for the OceanBase cluster, including the instance name, IP address, port, the user for connecting, and the user's password. Here is an example:
    
    ```shell
    obclient -h10.10.10.1 -uusername@obtenant#obdemo -P2883 -p****** -c -A oceanbase
    ```
   
   If you need to create a new user, grant the account permissions based on Bytebase's authorization requirements and your actual business needs. For more details, refer to [Create a user](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-10000000001231781).

## Procedure

1. Log in to the Bytebase platform, follow the prompts to create a workspace and enter your workspace.
   
   ![Bytebase](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/cloud/420/en/bytebase-2.png)

2. Click **Add Instance** and select **OceanBase (MySQL)** in the pop-up box.
    
    ![Add Instance](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/cloud/420/en/bytebase-1.png)

    | Field | Description |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | Instance Name | Specify your instance name. For example, obdemo. |
    | Environment | Select the Test or Pro environment based on your needs. |
    | Host or Socket | Enter the address obtained from the `-h` parameter of the connection string. For example, 10.10.10.1. |
    | Port | Enter the port number obtained from the `-p` parameter of the connection string. For example, 2883. |
    | Username | Enter the username obtained from the `-u` parameter of the connection string. For example, username@obtenant. |
    | Password | Enter the password obtained from the `-p` parameter of the connection string. For example, ******. |

3. Click **Test Connection**.
   
   After the connection is successful, click **Create**.

4. After the creation is complete, you can integrate with GitOps.

   * If you need to enable the GitOps workflow, you can integrate with your code repository service, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket Cloud, in Bytebase.
   
   * Configure Git repositories to store database change scripts and submit changes to the corresponding branches. Bytebase will automatically pull changes and execute the approval and release process.

   <!-- For more information, see [Enable GitOps Workflow in Project](http://101.133.156.15/docs/vcs-integration/enable-gitops-workflow/). -->

5. Manage database changes.

   * Create SQL migration scripts and submit change requests through the Bytebase interface.
   * Participate in the review process and collaborate with other team members to review SQL changes.
   * After approval, execute the approved changes, and Bytebase will automatically apply them to the target database within the preset time window.
