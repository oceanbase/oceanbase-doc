# Read and synchronize OceanBase data using SeaTunnel

SeaTunnel is a distributed, highly scalable data integration platform for transferring data between various data storage systems. It provides easy-to-configure data flow task plugins, allowing users to define processes for data processing and transformation. For more information about SeaTunnel, refer to SeaTunnel's [GitHub page](https://github.com/apache/incubator-seatunnel).

## Prerequisites

Before you migrate data, make sure that:

* You have downloaded SeaTunnel.
* You have installed Java 1.8 or a higher version.
* You have downloaded the MySQL driver into the `lib` directory.
* You have installed OBLogProxy.

# Read data using SeaTunnel

This section introduces how to execute SQL queries in a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database by using SeaTunnel's MySQL CDC Source Connector. `connector-cdc-mysql` is a plugin of SeaTunnel used to capture and stream real-time change data (Change Data Capture, CDC) from MySQL databases.

## Procedure

Follow the steps below to synchronize data between MySQL tenants in OceanBase Database:

1. Create a SeaTunnel user.

   ```sql
    CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO 'username';
   ```

2. Configure `config/plugin_config`.

    Specify `connector-cdc-mysql` and execute `sh bin/install-plugin.sh 2.3.3`.

3. Configure SeaTunnel.

    Modify the configuration file `config/v2.streaming.conf.template` as follows:

    ```yml
    source {
    # This is a example source plugin **only for test and demonstrate the feature source plugin**
    MySQL-CDC {
    result_table_name = "fake"
    parallelism = 1
    server-id = 5656
    username = "username"
    password = "password"
    table-names = ["seatunnel.full_types"]
    base-url = "jdbc:mysql://xx.xxx.x.xx:2881/seatunnel"
    }

    # If you would like to get more information about how to configure SeaTunnel and see full list of source plugins,
    # please go to https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/category/source-v2
    }
    ```

4. Start SeaTunnel.

    Run the following command to start SeaTunnel:

    ```shell
    ./bin/seatunnel.sh --config ./config/v2.streaming.conf.template -e local
    ```

tab Synchronize data using SeaTunnel

# Synchronize data using SeaTunnel

This section introduces how to synchronize data using SeaTunnel's JDBC OceanBase Source Connector and JDBC OceanBase Sink Connector. JDBC OceanBase Source Connector supports full reading and writing of data from a single table in OceanBase Database. For more information, see [JDBC OceanBase Source Connector](https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/2.3.3/connector-v2/source/OceanBase/). JDBC OceanBase Sink Connector supports full read and write on multi-table data in OceanBase. For more information, see [JDBC OceanBase Sink Connector](https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/2.3.3/connector-v2/sink/OceanBase/).

## Procedure

Follow the steps below to synchronize data between MySQL tenants in OceanBase Database:

1. Create a SeaTunnel user.

   ```sql
    CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON *.* TO 'username';
   ```

2. Configure `config/plugin_config`.
3. Download OceanBase JDBC driver to the `lib` directory. For more information, see [OceanBase Client]( https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.oceanbase/oceanbase-client).
4. Configure SeaTunnel.

    Modify the configuration file `config/ob_to_ob` as follows:

    ```yml
    env {
    parallelism = 1
    job.mode = "BATCH"
    }

    source {
    # This is a example source plugin **only for test and demonstrate the feature source plugin**
    Jdbc {
        driver = com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver
        url = "jdbc:oceanbase://e2e_oceanbase_mysql:2881/seatunnel?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&serverTimezone=UTC"
        user = "username"
        password = "password"
        query = "SELECT c_bit_1, c_bit_8 FROM source"
        compatible_mode = "mysql"
    }

    # If you would like to get more information about how to configure seatunnel and see full list of source plugins,
    # please go to https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/connector-v2/source/FakeSource
    }

    sink {
    Jdbc {
        driver = com.oceanbase.jdbc.Driver
        url = "jdbc:oceanbase://e2e_oceanbase_mysql:2881/seatunnel?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&serverTimezone=UTC"
        user = "username"
        password = "password"
        query = "insert into sink(c_bit_1, c_bit_8) values (?, ?);"
        compatible_mode = "mysql"
    }
    # If you would like to get more information about how to configure seatunnel and see full list of sink plugins,
    # please go to https://seatunnel.apache.org/docs/connector-v2/sink
    }
    ```

5. Start SeaTunnel.

    Run the following command to start SeaTunnel:

    ```shell
    ./bin/seatunnel.sh --config ./config/ob_to_ob -e local
    ```
