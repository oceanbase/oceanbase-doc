# log_tool

Commit logs (clogs) in OceanBase Database are similar to redo logs in a conventional database. They persist the transaction data when transactions are committed. The transaction data is the record of transaction modifications to the database. log_tool parses and prints clog files. This topic describes how to use log_tool. 

log_tool is equivalent to clog_tool in earlier versions and is updated for adaptation in OceanBase Database V4.x. Specifically, some command formats are modified and some features are deleted. 

## log_tool commands

log_tool is integrated into ob_admin. You can run the `ob_admin` command to call log_tool.
The following table describes the general commands of log_tool. 

| Command | Description                                                                                       |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `dump_log` | Parses and prints the specified clog file.                                                        |
| `dump_tx_format` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the file in a format that is similar to SQL statements. |
| `dump_filter` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the log records that meet the specified conditions.     |
| `stat` | Parses the specified clog file and prints the statistics of the file.                             |

### dump_log

```Shell
ob_admin log_tool dump_log <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can run the `dump_log` command to parse and print the specified clog file. If you want to parse multiple files, separate the file names with spaces. 

* You must replace the `clog_file_name` string with the actual file name. The path of the file can be included in `clog_file_name`. Examples:

   * To parse and print a single clog file that is named `101` and located in the current directory, run the following command: 

      ```Shell
      ob_admin log_tool dump_log 101
      ```

   * To parse and print multiple clog files that are named `101` and `103` and located in the current directory, run the following command: 

      ```Shell
      ob_admin log_tool dump_log 101 103
      ```

   * To parse and print multiple clog files that are consecutively named `101`, `102`, `103`, and `104` and located in the current directory, run the following command: 

      ```Shell
      ob_admin log_tool dump_log {101..104}
      ```

### dump_filter

```Shell
ob_admin log_tool dump_filter '<filter_name>' <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can use `dump_filter` to print the transaction-related content in clog files based on conditions. 

* For more information about `<clog_file_name>`, see [dump_log](#dump_log). 

* You can filter log records by specifying filter conditions in the `filter_name` field. The following table describes the valid values of filter_name.

   |     Value     |   Description    |
   |----------------|---------|
   | `tablet_id`    |The ID of a data table.|
   | `tx_id`        |The ID of a transaction.|


   You can specify one or multiple filter conditions in the `filter_name` field. If you specify multiple filter conditions, separate the conditions with semicolons (;). Examples:

   * Assume that `tablet_id` is set to `123`, and the clog file is named `101` and located in the current directory. Run the following command to parse and print this clog file. 

      ```Shell
      ob_admin log_tool dump_filter 'tablet_id=123' 101
      ```

   * Assume that `tablet_id` is set to `123`, `tx_id` is set to `26058724`, and the clog file to be parsed is named `101` and located in the current directory. Run the following command to parse and print this clog file. 

      ```Shell
      ob_admin log_tool dump_filter 'tablet_id=123;tx_id=26058724' 101
      ```

### stat

```Shell
ob_admin log_tool stat <clog_file_name>
```

Usage notes:

* You can use the `stat` command to obtain statistics of the specified clog file, including the file size, number of records, and number of transactions.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>By using the <code>CLOG_TOOL_BREAK_ON_FAIL</code> environment variable, clog_tool can control whether to directly exit or ignore errors and continue. When <code>CLOG_TOOL_BREAK_ON_FAIL</code> is set to true, clog_tool directly exits. When <code>CLOG_TOOL_BREAK_ON_FAIL</code> is set to false, clog_tool ignores errors and continues parsing the specified clog file. </p>
