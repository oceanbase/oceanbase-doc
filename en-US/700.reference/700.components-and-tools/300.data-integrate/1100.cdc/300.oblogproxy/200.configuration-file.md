# Configuration file

The following table describes parameters provided in the conf.json file of oblogproxy. By default, the configuration file is stored in the `/conf/` directory. You only need to modify parameters described in [Build oblogproxy by using the source code](100.install-and-deploy-oblogproxy/200.use-source-code-to-build-an-oblogproxy.md) as needed. We recommend that you do not modify other parameters unless you fully understand their purposes.
