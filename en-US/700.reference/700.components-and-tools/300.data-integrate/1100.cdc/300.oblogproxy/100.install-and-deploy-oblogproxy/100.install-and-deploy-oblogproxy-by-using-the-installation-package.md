# Install and deploy oblogproxy by using the installation package

You can deploy oblogproxy by downloading the installation package or using the source code. This topic describes how to deploy oblogproxy by downloading the installation package. 

## Background

oblogproxy is a proxy service for managing incremental logs of OceanBase Database. It is a part of OceanBase Migration Service (OMS). Designed based on obcdc, oblogproxy provides links for applications to access and manage real-time incremental logs of OceanBase Database. 

oblogproxy allows you to subscribe to incremental logs in isolated networks and supports multiple access methods. You can perform the following steps to configure and use oblogproxy. 

## Install oblogproxy

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>You do not need to specify information about OceanBase clusters when you configure oblogproxy. Technically, oblogproxy can subscribe to multiple OceanBase clusters when it is connected to all OBServer nodes by using the specified account and password of the sys tenant of each cluster. For security, the account and password are not exposed to oblogclient users. </li>
    <li>oblogproxy is stateless. It obtains information about databases and tables for data subscription from oblogclient. The information such as the timestamps of incremental logs is also stored by oblogclient. When oblogproxy resumes the connection to an OBServer node after disconnection, it is equivalent to creating a new connection. </li>
    <li>oblogproxy consumes a large amount of memory. We recommend that you deploy oblogproxy and the OBServer nodes on different servers to avoid affecting the database performance. </li>
    </ul>
  </main>

### Configure the YUM repository of OceanBase Database

```bash
yum install -y yum-utils
yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
```

### Download and install the precompiled package

Go to the [download page of open-source images](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/7/x86_64/) and download the precompiled package named "oblogproxy-xxxx.OS version.x86_64.rpm". You must select the package based on the version of your operating system and run the following command to install the package:

```bash
yum install -y oblogproxy-xxxx.OS version.x86_64.rpm
```

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>By default, oblogproxy will be installed in the <code>/usr/local/oblogproxy</code> directory. </p>
  </main>

### Configure the sys tenant.

For security, you must specify the username and password of a user for oblogproxy. Only a user in the sys tenant of OceanBase Database can be connected. 

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The username of this user cannot contain the cluster name or tenant name. </p>
  </main>

After you obtain the account and password of the sys tenant of your OBServer node, you must encrypt them and configure them for oblogproxy. Run the following commands to obtain the encrypted strings of the account and password:

```bash
# Assume that the account and password are user and pswd.
./logproxy -x user
# After you run the command, you will get the following string: 4B9C75F64934174F4E77EE0E9A58****
./logproxy -x pswd
# After you run the command, you will get the following string: DCE2AF09D006D6A440816880B938****
```

Copy the encrypted account and password strings to the `ob_sys_username` and `ob_sys_password` fields of the conf.json file in the `/usr/local/oblogproxy/conf/` directory. For example:

```bash
{
  "ob_sys_username": "4B9C75F64934174F4E77EE0E9A58****",
  "ob_sys_password": "DCE2AF09D006D6A440816880B938****"
}
```

### Run oblogproxy

You can run the following commands to start the service.

```bash
cd /usr/local/oblogproxy
bash ./run.sh start
```

By default, the `2983` port is listened to. You can set the `service_port` field in the `conf.json` file to change the port. The service logs of oblogproxy are stored in the `logs/` directory. The service logs of the LogReader thread are stored in the `run/{client-id}/logs/` directory.

    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You can then use oblogclient for OceanBase data subscription. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/oceanbase/oblogclient">Documentation</a>. </p>
  </main>

## Use oblogclient for data subscription

You can use oblogclient to subscribe to data from OceanBase Database. Make sure that you have installed [Maven](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.oceanbase.logclient/logproxy-client) dependencies before use. 

```java
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.oceanbase.logclient</groupId>
  <artifactId>logproxy-client</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.7</version>
</dependency>
```

After that, you can configure the oblogclient by referencing the following sample code:

```java
ObReaderConfig config = new ObReaderConfig();
// Specify the IP addresses of OceanBase root servers and separate multiple IP addresses with semicolons (;) in the following format: ip1:rpc_port1:sql_port1;ip2:rpc_port2:sql_port2
config.setRsList("xxx.xxx.xxx.1:2882:2881;xxx.xxx.xxx.2:2882:2881");
// Specify the username and password (user tenant).
config.setUsername("root");
config.setPassword("root");
// Specify the UNIX start timestamp in seconds. A value of 0 specifies to start the client from the current time. 
config.setStartTimestamp(0L);
// Specify the subscription allowlist in the tenant.db.table format. Use asterisks (*) as wildcards.
config.setTableWhiteList("sys.*.*");

// Specify the IP address of the server where oblogproxy is deployed to create the client instance.
LogProxyClient client = new LogProxyClient("xxx.xxx.xxx.1", 2983, config);
// Add the RecordListener
client.addListener(new RecordListener() {
    @Override
    public void notify(LogMessage message){
        // Process the message.
    }

    @Override
    public void onException(LogProxyClientException e) {
        // Handle the error.
        if (e.needStop()) {
            // Stop the client when an unrecoverable exception occurs.
            client.stop();
        }
    }
});

// Start the client
client.start();
client.join();
```
