# Overview

OceanBase Database is an enterprise-grade distributed database management system (DBMS) with excellent transactional and analytical processing capabilities. It is used in various business scenarios and has a complete peripheral support system.

As a proprietary DBMS, OceanBase Database supports both hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) with a single architecture, which combines the high scalability of a distributed system and the high efficiency of a centralized system.

OceanBase Database provides the same atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) capability in both centralized and distributed modes. It uses the Paxos protocol-based multi-replica synchronization algorithm, which guarantees consistency among multiple data replicas. In case a hardware failure occurs, OceanBase Database can quickly perform a replica switchover to ensure the availability of database services. In addition, it is compatible with MySQL syntaxes, making it easy to migrate your data from a MySQL database to an OceanBase database. Moreover, OceanBase Database uses code-based compression to significantly reduce storage space required.

OceanBase Database ranks No.1 in the TPC-C benchmark test with a performance result of 707.35 million tpmC and ranks No.2 in the TPC-H benchmark test with a performance result of 15.26 million QphH@30,000 GB.

OceanBase Database has supported the stable and efficient operation of core business systems of customers in various industries, such as banking, insurance, transportation, and telecommunications.

## Core features

OceanBase Database provides the following features:

* Higher stability

   OceanBase Database has been supporting the Double 11 Shopping Festival (the biggest online shopping festival in the world) for 9 consecutive years and has been tested in core systems of Ant Group with more than a million servers. It supports single-server failure recovery, cross-city cross-IDC disaster recovery, and multi-replica data storage. OceanBase has innovatively launched a new city-level disaster recovery standard of "Five IDCs across Three Cities". OceanBase can achieve Recovery Point Objective (RPO) = 0, Recovery Time Objective (RTO) ≤ 8 seconds, which reaches the financial-grade disaster recovery standard level 6.

* Stronger performance

   OceanBase Database supports online transaction processing (OLTP) and online analytical processing (OLAP), even in the case of massive data. OLTP and OLAP resources are isolated from each other and can be linearly scaled. OceanBase Database achieves a performance result of 707.35 million tpmC in the TPC-C benchmark test and a performance result of 15.26 million QphH@30,000 GB in the TPC-H benchmark test.

* Improved KV query performance

   OceanBase Database has the OBKV capability, which provides NoSQL capabilities for the HBase and Table models. The performance of OBKV is exponentially improved with secondary indexing, which avoids HBase performance jitters.

* Lower storage and O&M costs

   OceanBase Database can be deployed on PC servers with low-end SSDs. Its high compression ratio reduces storage costs, and its decentralized multi-tenant architecture significantly improves the utilization of compute resources. It also supports popular tools in the database ecosystem, such as Prometheus and Canal, which makes O&M easier.

* Compatible with MySQL open source ecosystem

   OceanBase Database is highly compatible with the MySQL ecosystem and provides modular tools that allow users to manage the entire lifecycle of a database, including development, debugging, production, O&M, and data transmission.
