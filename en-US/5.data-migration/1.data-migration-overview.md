* Cluster load adjustment and IDC relocation
* Data export to files and data import from files to databases
* Database replacement
* Logical database replication, including read/write splitting, database disaster recovery, and multi-site high availability for business
* Data replication for business
   OceanBase Database provides various data migration and replication methods, including:
* Migrate data by using OceanBase Migration Service (OMS) (recommended)
* Migrate data by using OBLOADER and OBDUMPER
   * Import data by using OBLOADER
   * Export data by using OBDUMPER
* Migrate data by using SQL scripts
* Migrate data by using MyDumper
* Migrate data by using DataX
* Migrate data by using an OUTFILE statement
* Migrate data by using DBCAT
