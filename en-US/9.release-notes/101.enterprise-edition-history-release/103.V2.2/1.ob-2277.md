V2.2.77 BP1
--------------------------------

### Version information

* Release date: May 27, 2021.

* Version: V2.2.77 BP1

### Enhanced features

* You can specify the maximum memory usage of partitions in a transaction by setting the tenant-level parameter `_tenant_max_trx_size`.

### Fixed issues

* The observer process unexpectedly exits when the memory is insufficient and the memory request fails.

* The `plan cache` has memory leaks.

* The `Nested Loop Join` operator may cause the observer process to unexpectedly exit in the TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX PRIMARY KEY operation.

* When foreign keys exist, the `Semi-Join` rewrite generates incorrect results.

* The observer process unexpectedly exits when an intermediate result set is released.

* In Oracle mode, the `WIDTH_BUCKET()` function is incompatible with Oracle when `min_value` is less than `expression`.

* In Oracle mode, the `RPAD()` function is incompatible with Oracle.

### Upgrade and limits

* The primary and standby clusters can be upgraded only in maximum performance mode. If a cluster is in maximum protection mode or maximum availability mode, you must switch the cluster to maximum performance mode before you can upgrade the cluster.

## V2.2.77 BP12


### Version information

* Release date: June 14, 2022

* Version: V2.2.77 BP12

### Fixed issues

* In Oracle mode, when you create a stored procedure with the specified character set GBK, the OBServer becomes suspended unexpectedly during the SQL prepare phase.
* In MySQL mode, an error is returned because the Limit operator does not support character type conversion.
* When the system performs a follower-to-leader switchover during a major compaction, the SQL statement is rolled back because the cached route is inaccurate. This causes a long execution time.
* The error code 4007 is returned when the DBMS_LOB.SUBSTR system package is executed in Oracle mode.
* The queue_time field is displayed as a negative value in the v$sql_audit view.
* In the sys tenant, the resource specifications are not restored to the default settings after a unit is removed.
* When the input parameter is converted during the execution of a stored procedure, the following error is returned: value too large for column.
* In multi-table join queries, the CPU utilization is high when the join key has an index and a ROWNUM or LIMIT operator.
* When a null condition is used to query the INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS view, incorrect results are returned.
* The observer process unexpectedly exits due to an exception occurring in table access by global index primary key. This is caused because the background thread does not initialize the tenant context.
* The observer process unexpectedly exits because the cluster is stopped while data is written to Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS) or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS).
* A syntax error is returned when the DBMS_LOB system package is executed to insert data.
* The logs of the Root Service node repeatedly report errors because an exception occurs when an index is created.

### Upgrade and limits

* The primary and standby clusters can be upgraded only in maximum performance mode. If a cluster is in maximum protection mode or maximum availability mode, you must switch the cluster to maximum performance mode before you can upgrade the cluster.
* PL debugging is supported only for x86 platforms. We recommend that you do not use this feature on an ARM platform.

## V2.2.77 BP13


### Version information

* Release date: August 26, 2022

* Version: V2.2.77 BP13

### Enhanced features

* Adding partitions is supported in specific scenarios. You can add partitions at the beginning or in the middle of RANGE-partitioned tables. When you add a partition, make sure that no data is written to this partition. You can enable this feature by using the tenant-level parameter `_enable_add_between_range_partitions`.
* Cluster-level parameters of a specific OBServer can be modified by using ob_admin. However, tenant-level parameters cannot be modified for a specific OBServer.
* Backup files on Tencent Cloud COS can be tagged to facilitate file management.
   Fixed issues
* The cluster restart times out due to an excessive number of schema history records.
* In MySQL mode, an error is returned for invalid characters generated during the conversion of the GBK character set by calling the CONVERT() function. In this version, the invalid characters are converted to 0x3F, which is compatible with MySQL.
* In the primary-standby deployment mode, records in the virtual table `__all_server_event_history` expand fast due to frequent execution of the ALTER SYSTEM CHANGE TENANT operation on the primary database.
* During the execution of a distributed plan, when one OBServer fails, the execution of SQL statements on other OBServers hangs until timeout.
* When an equivalent condition is used to detect the case sensitivity of the collation, the returned result set is wrong because an execution plan is incorrectly hit.
* When a backup task is forcibly canceled, the backup status stays in Stopping.
* When the `INSERT...ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` statement is executed, an error indicating duplicated primary keys is returned.
* An error is returned during the execution of a nested aggregate operator that contains Distinct.
* Invalid log information about RPC communication between OBServers is deleted.
* When the `__min_full_resource_pool_memory` parameter is set to an abnormal value, the OBServer can still be started.
* When the `LAST_INSERT_ID()` function is called within a stored procedure, a invalid execution result is generated.
* The error code 4016 is returned when a partition is truncated.
* An error occurs for the data of the net_wait_time field in the gv$sql_audit view.
* When the weak_read_version_refresh_interval parameter is set to 0, the data in partitions is not synchronized.
* The query timeout hint added to the cursor of a stored procedure does not take effect.
* In Oracle mode, when a prepared statement is enabled, the return value of the NUMTODSINTERVAL() function is truncated to a specific precision.
* After a partition is dropped or truncated, the locality change is suspended due to duplicate global indexes.

### Upgrade and limits

* The primary and standby clusters can be upgraded only in maximum performance mode. If a cluster is in maximum protection mode or maximum availability mode, you must switch the cluster to maximum performance mode before you can upgrade the cluster.
* PL debugging is supported only for x86 platforms. We recommend that you do not use this feature on an ARM platform.
