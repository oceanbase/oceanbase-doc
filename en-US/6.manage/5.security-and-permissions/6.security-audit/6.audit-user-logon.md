This topic describes how to use AuditTrail to audit the logon operations of users.

## Limits

OceanBase Database supports AuditTrail only in Oracle mode.

## Audit the logon operations of a specified user

Log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and specify to audit logon operations of the `aud` user.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT SESSION BY user1;
```

## Audit the logon operations of all users

Log on to the database as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and specify to audit logon operations of all users.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT SESSION;
```

## View audit records

View the audit records in the `DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL` table.

```shell
obclient> SELECT USERNAME,USERHOST,TIMESTAMP,SQL_TEXT FROM SYS.DBA_AUDIT_TRAIL;
+----------+----------------+-----------+----------+
| USERNAME | USERHOST       | TIMESTAMP | SQL_TEXT |
+----------+----------------+-----------+----------+
| USER1    | 10.10.10.10    | 22-DEC-21 | CONNECT  |
+----------+----------------+-----------+----------+
1 row in set
```
