# Password complexity

OceanBase Database allows you to set password complexity in MySQL mode, in order to verify the identity of login users, prevent malicious password attacks, thereby improving database security. This topic describes how to set password complexity for users who attempt to log in to OceanBase Database. 

## Related variables

In MySQL mode of OceanBase Database, you can set a series of tenant-level system variables to define password complexity rules. When a user is created or when a user changes the login password, the password is verified according to the system variable settings. If the password verification fails, an error is returned. The following table describes the related system variables:

| Variable | Description | Value Range |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| validate_password_check_user_name | Specifies whether the user password can be identical to the username.  | <ul><li>`on`: The user password cannot be identical to the username. </li><li>`off`: The user password can be identical to the username. Default value: `off`. </li></ul> |
| validate_password_length | The minimum length of a user's password.  | Default value: 0.  |
| validate_password_mixed_case_count | The minimum number of uppercase or lowercase letters required in a user's password.  | Default value: 0.  |
| validate_password_number_count | The minimum number of digits required in a user's password.  | Default value: 0.  |
| validate_password_policy | Password check policy.  | <ul><li>`low`: Only performs password length check. </li><li>`medium`: Performs password length check, uppercase letter count check, lowercase letter count check, digit count check, special character count check, and username and password similarity check.  |
| validate_password_special_char_count | The minimum number of special characters required in a user's password.  | Default value: 0.  |

## Set password complexity

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice:</h4>
    <p>In a production environment, it is recommended to set a password length of 20 characters, including digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters. The lower the complexity of the password, the greater the likelihood that it will be cracked, such as including the username, using repeated characters, etc. For security reasons, it is necessary to ensure that user passwords have high complexity. 
    </li></p>
  </main>

The following example provides guidance on setting password complexity rules. In this example, the password has a minimum length of 8 characters, including at least 3 uppercase or lowercase letters, and 1 special character. The password cannot be identical to the username, and the password check policy is set to  `medium`. 

1. Log in to a MySQL tenant of a cluster using the root user. 

   ```shell
   obclient -uroot@mysql -P2881 -h10.xxx.xxx.1 -p***1***
   ```

2. Set password complexity through system variables. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_check_user_name=on;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_length=8;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_mixed_case_count=3;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_special_char_count=1;
   obclient> SET GLOBAL validate_password_policy='medium';
   ```

3. Log out and log in again to check whether the variables are effective. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate%';
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   | VARIABLE_NAME                        | VALUE  |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   | validate_password_check_user_name    | on     |
   | validate_password_length             | 8      |
   | validate_password_mixed_case_count   | 3      |
   | validate_password_number_count       | 0      |
   | validate_password_policy             | medium |
   | validate_password_special_char_count | 1      |
   +--------------------------------------+--------+
   6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

4. Verify password complexity. 

   Create two users, one with a password that meets the requirements and the other with a password that does not meet the requirements. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER sectest1 IDENTIFIED BY '***1**';
   ERROR 1819 (HY000): Your password does not satisfy the current policy
   requirements
   
   obclient> CREATE USER sectest1 IDENTIFIED BY '***1_%';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   The creation of the user with a password that does not meet the requirements fails.
