# Login failure processing

If OceanBase Database is in MySQL mode, for users who have multiple failed login attempts, the system will lock the user to prevent malicious password attacks, thereby improving database security.

## Logon failure processing policy

In MySQL mode, OceanBase Database controls the threshold of failed login attempts by using a tenant-level configuration item called `connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`. When a user exceeds the value defined by this configuration item for consecutive failed login attempts, the system locks the account.

The default value of the `connection_control_failed_connections_threshold` configuration item is `0`, and the value range is \[0, 2147483647\]. Note the following:

* When the configuration item is set to `0`, it means that this feature is turned off, and the system will not process the user's failed login attempts. 

* When the configuration item is not set to `0`, if a user's failed login attempts exceed the specified value, the system will lock the account. The specific lock time is calculated using the following formula:

   `MIN(MAX((current_failed_login_num + 1 - connection_control_failed_connections_threshold) * 1000, connection_control_min_connection_delay), connection_control_max_connection_delay)`

   where

   * `current_failed_login_num`: the number of consecutive failed login attempts by the user. The  `current_failed_login_num` is greater than or equal to `connection_control_failed_connections_threshold`. 

   * `connection_control_min_connection_delay`: the minimum lock time after exceeding the threshold of consecutive failed login attempts. The value range is \[1000, 2147483647\] and the default value is `1000`, measured in milliseconds. 

      For more information about `connection_control_min_connection_delay`, see [connection_control_min_connection_delay](../../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/1.system-configuration-items/4.tenant-level-configuration-items/6.connection_control_min_connection_delay.md). 

   * `connection_control_max_connection_delay`: the maximum lock time after exceeding the threshold of consecutive failed login attempts. The value range is \[1000, 2147483647\] and the default value is `2147483647`, measured in milliseconds. 

      For more information about `connection_control_max_connection_delay`, see [connection_control_max_connection_delay](../../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/1.system-configuration-items/4.tenant-level-configuration-items/7.connection_control_max_connection_delay.md). 

## Configuration example

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of a cluster using the root user. 

   ```shell
   obclient -uroot@mysql -h127.1 -P2881 -p****1***
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to set the maximum number of failed login attempts for a user to 5. The minimum lock time for failed login attempts after exceeding the threshold is set to 60,000 milliseconds and the maximum lock time is 360,000 milliseconds. 

   Example:

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET connection_control_failed_connections_threshold=5;

   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET connection_control_min_connection_delay=60000;

   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET connection_control_max_connection_delay=360000;
   ```

   For more information about the parameters, see [Modify cluster parameters](../../../../7.reference/2.administrator-guide/2.basic-database-management/2.configuration-management/2.set-parameters.md). 

3. Create a user. 

   ```shell
   obclient> CREATE USER 'test' IDENTIFIED BY '***1***';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.04 sec)
   ```

4. Check whether the login failure processing policy is effective.
   If 5 consecutive incorrect passwords are entered, the user will be locked. 

   ```shell
   obclient -h127.1 -P2881 -utest@mysql -p**123**;
   obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
   ERROR 5039 (01007): User locked
   ```

   Log on to a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database using the root user, to view the login failure information. 

   ```shell
   obclient> SELECT * FROM information_schema.CONNECTION_CONTROL_FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS;
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | USERHOST    | FAILED_ATTEMPTS |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   | 'test'@'%' |               5 |
   +-------------+-----------------+
   1 row in set (0.005 sec)
   ```

5. Execute the following SQL statement to unlock the user. 

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice:</h4>
    <p>The operation of unlocking a user is generally performed by the administrator. If an ordinary user needs to perform lock and unlock operations, they must have global <code>ALTER USER</code> privileges. For information about how to view and grant user privileges, see <a href="../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/2.permission-of-mysql-mode/4.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md">View user privileges</a> and <a href="../../../../6.manage/5.security-and-permissions/3.access-control/2.user-and-permission/2.permission-of-mysql-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md">Modify user privileges</a>.</p>
   </main>

   ```shell
      obclient> ALTER USER test ACCOUNT UNLOCK;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.03 sec)
   ```
