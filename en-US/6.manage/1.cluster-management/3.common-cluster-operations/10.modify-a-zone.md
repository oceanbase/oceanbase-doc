# Modify a zone

You can modify the region and IDC of a zone.

## Limitations

Currently, you cannot modify the type of a zone.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Run the following command to log on. You must replace the related information in the command based on the actual database environment.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to modify the attributes of a zone:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM {ALTER|CHANGE|MODIFY} ZONE zone_name SET [IDC [=]'idc_name', REGION [=]'region_name'];
   ```

   * `{ALTER|CHANGE|MODIFY}`: indicates that the features of the `ALTER`, `CHANGE`, and `MODIFY` keywords are the same. You can use any keyword to modify the attributes of the zone.

   * `zone_name`: the name of the zone whose attributes are to be modified. This statement modifies only one zone at a time.

   * `idc_name`: the name of the IDC where the zone is located.

   * `region_name`: the name of the region where the zone is located.

   For example, to modify the region of the current cluster to `Shanghai` and the IDC to `sh1`, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM ALTER ZONE zone4 SET REGION 'shanghai',IDC 'sh1';
   ```

3. After the statement is executed, you can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES` view to verify whether the attributes are modified.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;
