# Perform an upgrade

This topic describes how to use the upgrade script to upgrade OceanBase Database.

## Prerequisites

Python 2.7 and the following modules have been installed on the OBServer node:

* `datetime`
* `sys`
* `os`
* `mysql.connector`
* `logging`
* `getopt`
* `time`

## Procedure

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>When you perform the following steps to execute the upgrade script, the value of the <code>-u</code> parameter must be a user that has the read/write and SUPER privileges in the sys tenant.</p>
</main>

### Step 1: Back up the cluster parameters

Before the upgrade, back up the values of the following parameters, which are used for restoration after the upgrade.

* `server_permanent_offline_time`
* `enable_rebalance`
* `enable_rereplication`

Execute the following statement to obtain cluster-level parameters:

```shell
obclient [(none)]> SELECT SVR_IP,ZONE,NAME,VALUE FROM OCEANBASE.GV$OB_PARAMETERS WHERE NAME IN ("server_permanent_offline_time", "enable_rebalance", "enable_rereplication");
+------------+-------+-------------------------------+-------+
| SVR_IP     | ZONE  | NAME                          | VALUE |
+------------+-------+-------------------------------+-------+
| 10.10.10.2 | zone1 | enable_rebalance              | True  |
| 10.10.10.2 | zone1 | enable_rereplication          | True  |
| 10.10.10.2 | zone1 | server_permanent_offline_time | 3600s |
| 10.10.10.1 | zone2 | enable_rebalance              | True  |
| 10.10.10.1 | zone2 | enable_rereplication          | True  |
| 10.10.10.1 | zone2 | server_permanent_offline_time | 3600s |
| 10.10.10.3 | zone3 | enable_rebalance              | True  |
| 10.10.10.3 | zone3 | enable_rereplication          | True  |
| 10.10.10.3 | zone3 | server_permanent_offline_time | 3600s |
+------------+-------+-------------------------------+-------+

### Step 2: Upload and decompress the RPM package

1. Run the `scp` command to decompress the RPM package of the target version to the OBServer node.

   In the command, `$rpm_name` specifies the name of the RPM package, `observer_ip` specifies the IP address of the OBServer node, and `$rpm_dir` specifies the directory where the RPM package is located.

   ```shell
   [root@xxx /]# scp $rpm_name admin@observer_ip:/$rpm_dir
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>Contact OceanBase Technical Support to obtain the OceanBase Database installation package of the target version. </p>
    </main>

2. Decompress the RPM package to the current directory.

   `$rpm_name` specifies the name of the RPM package.

   ```shell
   [root@xxx $rpm_dir]# rpm2cpio $rpm_name | cpio -div
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>After the RPM package is decompressed, the <code>home</code> and <code>use</code> directories are generated in the directory where the RPM package is located. The upgrade script and the <code>oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml</code> file are stored in the <code>home/admin/oceanbase/etc</code> directory. </p>
    </main>

### Step 3: View the upgrade dependencies of different versions

View the upgrade dependencies in the `oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml` file in the `/rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc` directory.

For example:

```shell
[root@xxx /rpm_dir]# cd home/admin/oceanbase/etc
[root@xxx /rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# cat oceanbase_upgrade_dep.yml
# Describe the upgrade dependencies of different OceanBase Database versions.

# For each officially released OceanBase Database version, a record with the following attributes is added to the .yaml file:
#  * version: the source version or a transition version during the upgrade. The value is a version number in the A.B.C format. If the value is in the A.B.C-D format, the build number must be greater than or equal to D.
#  * can_be_upgraded_to: the target versions that the current version can be *directly* upgraded to. The value is a list of versions that are determined through compatibility tests by the QA of OceanBase Database.
#  * deprecated: indicates whether the current version has been deprecated. The default value is False. The value True indicates that the current version has been deprecated and can serve as the source version or a transition version of the upgrade, but cannot be the target version of the upgrade.
#  * require_from_binary: The default value is False. The value True indicates that if the current version acts as a transition version of the upgrade, you must run the upgrade script and upgrade the OBServer node to this version.
#

# The OceanBase Database upgrade module of OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) will read this file. Given the source and target versions of the upgrade, the upgrade module will automatically
# determine the shortest upgrade path if the preceding requirements are met. Algorithm:
# The upgrade module builds a diagram based on the following descriptions. Each version is represented by a node and the value of can_be_upgraded_to is represented by a
# side. The upgrade module will find the shortest path between the source and target versions. Except the start node, other nodes in an upgrade path
# must not represent a version that has been deprecated. If two version formats A.B.C and A.B.C-D are matched, the latter is preferred.
#
#

- version: 4.0.0.0
  can_be_upgraded_to:
      - 4.1.0.0
  require_from_binary:
    value: True
    when_come_from: [4.0.0.0]

- version: 4.1.0.0
  require_from_binary:
    value: True
    when_come_from: [4.0.0.0, 4.1.0.0]
```

### Step 4: Execute the upgrade_checker.py script

Specify the logon information for directly connecting to the OBServer node from the sys tenant. Run the `upgrade_checker.py` script to perform a precheck. If the script is successfully executed, you can continue with the upgrade.

For example:

```shell
[root@xxx /rpm_dir]# cd home/admin/oceanbase/etc
[root@xxx /rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# python upgrade_checker.py -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u xxxx@sys -p******
```

### Step 5: Run the upgrade_pre.py script

Specify the logon information for directly connecting to the OBServer node from the sys tenant. Run the `upgrade_pre.py` script. If the script is successfully executed, you can continue with the upgrade.

For example:

```shell
[root@xxx /rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# python upgrade_pre.py -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u xxxx@sys -p******
```

The `upgrade_pre.py` script will execute the following commands and actions:

1. `alter system begin upgrade`
2. `alter system begin rolling upgrade`
3. `special pre action`: to disable and adjust parameters.
4. `health check`: to perform a cluster-level health check.

Complete capabilities of the `upgrade_pre.py` script:

```shell
./upgrade_pre.py [OPTIONS]

-I, --help          Display this help and exit.
-V, --version       Output version information and exit.
-h, --host=name     Connect to host.
-P, --port=name     Port number to use for connection.
-u, --user=name     User for login.
-p, --password=name Password to use when connecting to server. If password is
                    not given it's empty string "".
-t, --timeout=name  Cmd/Query execute timeout(s).
-m, --module=name   Modules to run. Modules should be a string combined by some of
                    the following strings:
                    1. begin_upgrade
                    2. begin_rolling_upgrade
                    3. special_action
                    4. health_check
                    5. all: "all" represents that all modules should be run.
                    They are splitted by ",".
                    For example: -m all, or --module=begin_upgrade,begin_rolling_upgrade,special_action
-l, --log-file=name Log file path. If log file path is not given it's ./upgrade_pre.log


Maybe you want to run cmd like that:
./upgrade_pre.py -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u ******  -p ******
```

### Step 6: Upgrade the cluster

The cluster is upgraded zone by zone. Therefore, you must perform the following steps for each zone. The following describes the upgrade procedure by taking `zone1` as an example.

1. Perform a cluster-level health check.

   ```shell
   [root@xxx /rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# python upgrade_health_checker.py -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u xxxx@sys -p******
   ```

2. Execute the `STOP ZONE` statement to stop the zone.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM STOP ZONE 'zone1';
   ```

   The `STOP ZONE` statement will return a success only after all leaders are migrated out of the zone.

3. Stop the observer processes on the OBServer nodes in the zone. Replace the binary files with those of the new database version and then restart the processes.

4. Perform a zone-level health check.

   ```shell
   [root@xxx /rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# python upgrade_health_checker.py  -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u xxxx@sys -p****** -z 'zone1'
   ```

   The logic of the zone-level health check is the same as that of the cluster-level health check and aims to verify the status of all OBServer nodes in the zone.

5. Start the zone.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE 'zone1';
   ```

6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 until the cluster is upgraded in all zones.

### Step 7: Execute the upgrade_post.py script

Specify the logon information for directly connecting to the OBServer node from the sys tenant. Execute the `upgrade_post.py` script to complete the major upgrade operations and related checks.

For example:

```shell
[root@xxx /rpm_dir/home/admin/oceanbase/etc]# python upgrade_post.py -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u xxxx@sys -p******
```

This script completes the following major upgrade operations and related checks:

1. Perform a cluster-level health check.
2. `alter system end rolling upgrade`.
3. Perform the BEGIN UPGRADE operation.
4. Correct system variables by tenant.
5. Correct system tables by tenant.
6. Correct virtual tables and views by tenant.
7. Perform related upgrade operations by tenant.
8. Perform a self-check on internal tables by tenant.
9. Perform the END UPGRADE operation.
10. End the upgrade state of the cluster by using the ALTER SYSTEM END UPGRADE statement.
11. Enable the parameters disabled during the upgrade and perform a check.

Skip Step 3 to 5, Step 7, and Step 9 in the following scenarios:

1. Intra-version upgrade
2. Cross-version upgrade in which the source and target versions have the same version of data

Complete capabilities of the `upgrade_post.py` script:

```shell
./upgrade_post.py [OPTIONS]

-I, --help          Display this help and exit.
-V, --version       Output version information and exit.
-h, --host=name     Connect to host.
-P, --port=name     Port number to use for connection.
-u, --user=name     User for login.
-p, --password=name Password to use when connecting to server. If password is
                    not given it's empty string "".
-t, --timeout=name  Cmd/Query execute timeout(s).
-m, --module=name   Modules to run. Modules should be a string combined by some of
                    the following strings:
                    1. health_check
                    2. end_rolling_upgrade
                    3. tenant_upgrade
                    4. end_upgrade
                    5. post_check
                    6. all: "all" represents that all modules should be run.
                    They are splitted by ",".
                    For example: -m all, or --module=health_check,begin_rolling_upgrade
-l, --log-file=name Log file path. If log file path is not given it's ./upgrade_pre.log


Maybe you want to run cmd like that:
./upgrade_post.py -h 127.0.0.1 -P 2881 -u *** -p ******
```

### Step 8: Restore the cluster parameters

Restore the parameters backed up in Step 1 to the original values.

For example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET server_permanent_offline_time = xxx;
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_rebalance = xxx;
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_rereplication = xxx;
```
