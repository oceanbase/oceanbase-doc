# Start a zone

You can start a zone to enable all servers in the zone to provide services. 

## Applicable scenarios

* If you add a new zone and it is in the `INACTIVE` state, you can start the zone to use the servers in this zone. 

* If the current zone is isolated due to business reasons and the zone is in the `INACTIVE` state, you can start the zone to cancel its isolation. 

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user. 

   Run the following command to log on. You must replace the related information in the command based on the actual database environment. 

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys -p***** -A
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to start the zone. 

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone_name;
   ```

   In the statement, `zone_name` specifies the name of the zone to be started. This statement starts only one zone at a time. 

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone4;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. After the statement is executed, you can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES` to verify whether the zone is started. 

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;

   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

   If the status of the zone changes from `INACTIVE` to `ACTIVE`, the zone is successfully started.
