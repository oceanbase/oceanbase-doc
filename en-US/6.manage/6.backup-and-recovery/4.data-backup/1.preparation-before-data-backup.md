# Preparations

You must configure the backup destination in the `DATA_BACKUP_DEST` parameter before backup. The sys tenant is used for managing clusters and does not contain user data or support backup and recovery. Therefore, you do not need to configure the backup destination for the `sys` tenant.

## Backup architecture

Followers are preferentially used for backup. The following figure shows the backup architecture:

![Backup architecture](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.0.0/user-guide/data-backup-architecture.png)

## Configure the backup destination

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.


   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
        <h4>Note:</h4>
        <p>The administrator user is <code>root</code> in MySQL mode and <code>SYS</code> in Oracle mode. </p>
   </main>

2. Configure the backup destination.

   OceanBase Database supports two types of media as the backup destination: Network File System (NFS) and Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS).

   * Configure the backup destination for a specified tenant in the sys tenant

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'data_backup_path' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * Configure the backup destination for the current tenant in a user tenant

      Sample statement:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'data_backup_path';
      ```

   Examples:

   * NFS

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice:</h4>
      <p>When you use NFS as the backup destination, note the following points:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The value of <code>data_backup_dest</code> cannot be a string with a question mark (?). </li>
      <li><code>data_backup_dest</code> must be set to an absolute path to ensure that the OBServer node has the write privilege on the backup destination<code></code>. </li>
      <li>Ensure that all OBServer nodes are mounted to NFS of the same server and use the parameter settings recommended in this topic. For more information about the procedure of mounting NFS, see <a href="../2.deploy-nfs.md">Deploy the NFS client</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      Set the backup destination to NFS:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data' TENANT = mysql_tenant;

      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data';
      ```

   * Alibaba Cloud OSS

      When you use OSS as the backup destination, you can set the backup destination and the `delete_mode` parameter to configure the backup file clearing mode.

      The `delete_mode` can be set to either of the following modes:

      * `delete` specifies that backup files that meet requirements are directly cleared.

         After you configure this mode, the system clears backup files that meet the requirements, regardless of whether the backup file clearing mode is automatic or manual. This is the default clearing mode. If you do not specify `delete_mode`, the default clearing mode `delete` is used.

      * `tagging` specifies that backup files that meet the clearing requirements are tagged and retained.

         After you configure this mode, the system tags backup files that meet the clearing requirements, regardless of whether the backup file clearing mode is automatic or manual. The key of the tag is set to `delete_mode` and the value is set to `tagging`. This way, you can manage the lifecycle of these files on OSS based on the specified tag.

      For more information about the automatic cleanup of backup data in `delete` or `tagging` mode, see [Automatic cleanup of expired backup data](../5.clear-backup-data/1.cleaning-up-backed-up-data-automatically.md).

      To set the backup destination and configure a backup file cleanup mode, execute the following statement:

      ```shell
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;

      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete';
      ```

3. Query for the backup paths of all tenants in the current cluster from the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER` view in the `sys` tenant.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER\G
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
   TENANT_ID: 1002
        NAME: data_backup_dest
       VALUE: file:///data/nfs/backup/data
   ```

## Usage notes

After you set the `data_backup_dest` parameter, the system will create a file named `format` by default in the directory where the configured destination is located. This file is used to verify the validity of the backup destination and ensure the integrity of the data at the destination. Therefore, pay attention to the following points when you configure the `data_backup_dest` parameter:

* If the `format` file does not exist, the directory where the configured destination is located must be empty so that the `LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST` parameter can be set. If this directory is not empty, the system returns the `-9081` error to indicate that the `format` file does not exist.

* If the `format` file exists, its content must be verified so that the parameter can be set. Otherwise, the system returns the `-9081` error to indicate that the `format` file does not match. The content of the `format` file is verified to check whether the types of the cluster, tenant, and backup destination in the file match those of the current cluster, tenant, and backup destination.

* When you execute a backup job, the job fails to be initiated if the `format` file does not exist or fails the verification.
