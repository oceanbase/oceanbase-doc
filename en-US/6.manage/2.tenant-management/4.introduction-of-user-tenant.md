# User tenants

A user tenant is like a general database management system. It is equivalent to a database instance. User tenants are created in the sys tenant based on business needs.
The characteristics of a user tenant are the same as that of a database instance. Major characteristics:

* Users can be created in a user tenant.
* All objects such as databases (supported only in MySQL mode) and tables can be created in a user tenant.
* A user tenant has a separate set of system tables and system views.
* A user tenant has a separate set of system variables.
* A user tenant has other characteristics of a database instance.

The metadata of all user data is stored in user tenants. Each tenant is assigned a unique namespace that is isolated from other namespaces. The sys tenant manages all user tenants. The following figure shows the hierarchy between the sys tenant and user tenants.

Users that are created in a user tenant can log on only to this user tenant and are invisible to other tenants.

* You can query the `mysql.user` view for information about MySQL tenants.
* You can query the `ALL_USERS` view for information about Oracle tenants.

The tables created in a user tenant are invisible to other tenants.

* You can query the `information_schema.tables` view for information about all user tables in a MySQL tenant.
* You can query the `ALL_TABLES` view for information about all user tables in an Oracle tenant.

A user tenant can modify only its own system variables.

* You can query the `information_schema.global_variables` and `information_schema.session_variables` views for system variables of a MySQL tenant. You can also execute the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement to query the system variables of a MySQL tenant.
* You can execute the `SHOW VARIABLES` statement to query the system variables of an Oracle tenant.
