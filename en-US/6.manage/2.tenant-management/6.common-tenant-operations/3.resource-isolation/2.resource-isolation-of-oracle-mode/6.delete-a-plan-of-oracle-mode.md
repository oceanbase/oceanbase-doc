# Delete a resource management plan

You can call the `DELETE_PLAN` subprogram in the `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER` package to delete an idle resource management plan.

## Prerequisites

The resource management plan to be deleted exists.

## Considerations

After a resource management plan is deleted, the plan directive associated with the resource management plan is also deleted.

## Procedure

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant in the cluster as the administrator of the tenant.

2. Call the `DELETE_PLAN` subprogram in the `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER` package to delete a resource management plan.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> delimiter //

   obclient [SYS]> BEGIN DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER.DELETE_PLAN(
   PLAN => 'plan_a'
   );
   END ;//

   obclient [SYS]> delimiter ;
   ```

   `PLAN` specifies the resource management plan to be deleted.

3. Query the `DBA_RSRC_PLANS` view to verify whether the resource management plan is deleted.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT PLAN_ID, PLAN, SUB_PLAN, COMMENTS FROM DBA_RSRC_PLANS;
   +---------+--------+----------+----------+
   | PLAN_ID | PLAN   | SUB_PLAN | COMMENTS |
   +---------+--------+----------+----------+
   |    NULL | PLAN_B | NULL     | NULL     |
   +---------+--------+----------+----------+
   1 row in set
   ```
