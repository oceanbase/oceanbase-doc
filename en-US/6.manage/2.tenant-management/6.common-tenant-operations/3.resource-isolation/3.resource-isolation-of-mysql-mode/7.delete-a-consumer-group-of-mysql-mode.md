# Delete a resource group

You can call the `DELETE_CONSUMER_GROUP` subprogram in the `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER` package to delete an idle resource group.

## Prerequisites

The resource group to be deleted exists.

## Considerations

After a resource group is deleted, the plan directive associated with the resource group is also deleted.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of the cluster as the administrator of the tenant.

2. Call the `DELETE_CONSUMER_GROUP` subprogram in the `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER` package to delete the resource group.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> CALL DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER.DELETE_CONSUMER_GROUP(
   CONSUMER_GROUP => 'interactive_group'
   );
   ```

   `CONSUMER_GROUP` specifies the name of the resource group to be deleted.

3. Query the `oceanbase.DBA_RSRC_CONSUMER_GROUPS` view to verify whether the resource group is deleted.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> SELECT CONSUMER_GROUP_ID, CONSUMER_GROUP, COMMENTS FROM oceanbase.DBA_RSRC_CONSUMER_GROUPS;
   +-------------------+----------------+-----------------+
   | CONSUMER_GROUP_ID | CONSUMER_GROUP | COMMENTS        |
   +-------------------+----------------+-----------------+
   |                 5 | batch_group    | AP              |
   |                 2 | group1         | Transaction processing team      |
   |                 3 | group2         | Daily O&M team      |
   |                 0 | OTHER_GROUPS   | NULL            |
   |                 1 | SYS_GROUP      | NULL            |
   +-------------------+----------------+-----------------+
   5 rows in set
   ```
