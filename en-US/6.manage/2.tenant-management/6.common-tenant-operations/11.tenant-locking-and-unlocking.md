# Lock and unlock a tenant

OceanBase Database allows you to lock a tenant. New connections cannot be created on a locked tenant, but existing connections are not affected. This topic describes how to lock and unlock a tenant.

## Background

You can execute the `ALTER TENANT` statement to lock or unlock a tenant for emergency responses to exceptions or for O&M changes.

* Emergency responses to exceptions: If a tenant is recovering from an exception, you can lock this tenant to prevent business traffic from affecting the recovery procedure with the consent of the customer. If you lock a tenant as an emergency action, you must kill the session after you lock the tenant.

* O&M changes: If a tenant must be removed, make sure that phased removal and data rollback are supported. In this case, you can lock the tenant to observe the impact on the business system.

## Lock a tenant

1. Log on to the sys tenant of the cluster as the root user.

   ```shell
   obclient -h172.30.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#cluster -p**** -A
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to go to the database named `oceanbase`:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> USE oceanbase;
   ```

3. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view for information about a tenant.

   To query the locking status of the `mq_t1` tenant, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID,TENANT_NAME,LOCKED FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'mq_t1';
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   |      1036 | mq_t1       | NO     |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   For more information about the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/4.system-view-of-mysql-mode/2.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/58.oceanbase-dba_ob_tenants-of-mysql-mode.md).

4. Execute the `ALTER TENANT` statement to lock the tenant.

   To lock the `mq_t1` tenant, execute the following statement.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER TENANT mq_t1 LOCK;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   For more information about the `ALTER TENANT` statement, see [ALTER TENANT](../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/1.system-tenants/5.alter-tenant.md).

5. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view to verify whether the tenant is successfully locked.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID,TENANT_NAME,LOCKED FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'mq_t1';
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   |      1036 | mq_t1       | YES    |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

2. Execute the following statement to go to the database named `oceanbase`:

   ```shell

4. Execute the `ALTER TENANT` statement to unlock the tenant.

   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
