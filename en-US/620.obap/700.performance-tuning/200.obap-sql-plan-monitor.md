# Use the GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR view for performance analysis

At present, the execution of SQL statements is not monitored at the operator level in analytical processing (AP) scenarios. For example, the number of tasks executed in parallel, whether data skew occurs, whether hash conflicts are serious, and a specific operator that is stuck when the execution hangs are not monitored at the operator level. Diagnostics depends on logs. To solve these problems, OceanBase Database provides the Oracle-compatible `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view. You can query this view for execution details of each operator.

## Overview

The `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view supports operator-level monitoring on SQL statements. Each row corresponds to one operator instance and records the monitoring data generated during running of the operator instance. The monitoring data includes general monitoring data and operator-specific monitoring data. The general monitoring data includes the number of rows of data processed by the operator, time when the operator was opened, time when the operator was closed, and the memory used. The operator-specific monitoring data includes a hash conflict rate, the number of blocks split by the `GI` operator, and the number of rows scanned by the `TABLE SCAN` operator.

The following table describes columns in the view.

| **Column** | **Type** | **Description** |
|---|---|---|
| CON_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the tenant. |
| SVR_IP | VARCHAR2(32) | The IP address of the OBServer node where the operator is executed. |
| SVR_PORT | NUMBER | The port number of the OBServer node where the operator is executed. |
| TRACE_ID | VARCHAR2(128) | The trace ID. |
| FIRST_REFRESH_TIME | DATE | The time when the monitoring of the operator started. |
| LAST_REFRESH_TIME | DATE | The time when the monitoring of the operator ended. |
| FIRST_CHANGE_TIME | DATE | The time when the operator output the first row of data. |
| LAST_CHANGE_TIME | DATE | The time when the operator output the last row of data. |
| PROCESS_NAME | VARCHAR2(6) | The ID of the thread that executed the operator. |
| SQL_ID | VARCHAR2(13) | The SQL ID. |
| PLAN_PARENT_ID | NUMBER | The ID of the parent operator of the plan. |

| USER_IO_WAIT_TIME | NUMBER | The necessary I/O wait time of the current operator, in microseconds. It includes the disk I/O time and network latency.  Note that the value does not include the time consumed in executing child operators.  |

The meaning and value of the `OTHERSTAT_N_VALUE` field can vary with operators.

You can query the `V$SQL_MONITOR_STATNAME` view based on the value of the `OTHERSTAT_N_ID` field.

## Examples

You can analyze performance issues based on the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view.

### Non-optimal index

```cpp
obclient [SYS]> select output_rows, plan_operation, OTHERSTAT_3_VALUE scans from gv$sql_plan_monitor where trace_id = 'xxx' and plan_operation like '%TABLE_SCAN';
+-------------+--------------------+--------+
| OUTPUT_ROWS | PLAN_OPERATION     | SCANS  |
+-------------+--------------------+--------+
|           5 | PHY_VEC_TABLE_SCAN | 500072 |
```

You can execute the preceding SQL statement to query the number of rows scanned by the `TABLE SCAN` operator and the number of rows returned. When the two values differ greatly, as shown in the preceding example where 500,000 rows are scanned but only five rows are returned, the table has no proper indexes.

### Non-optimal JOIN method

If the `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` operator is used in a scenario where the `HASH JOIN` is more suitable, the table on the right will be rescanned many times when the table on the left contains a large number of rows, which leads to poor performance. You can execute the following SQL statement to query the maximum number of rescans performed by the operator. If the value is large, the JOIN method is probably inappropriate.

```cpp
select max(starts) rescans from gv$sql_plan_monitor where trace_id = 'xxx';
```

### General analysis method

In most cases, you can use the following general method to identify the time-consuming part of a plan.

1. Execute the following SQL statement to query the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view for the corresponding records. The query result contains the time when each operator was opened, time when each operator was closed, time when each operator returned the first row, and time when each operator returned the last row.

   ```sql
   select plan_line_id, concat(lpad(' ', plan_depth, ' '), plan_operation) op, sum(output_rows) rowss, sum(STARTS) rescan, min(first_refresh_time) open_time, max(last_refresh_time) close_time, min(first_change_time) first_row_time, max(last_change_time) last_row_eof_time, count(1) threads from gv$sql_plan_monitor where trace_id = 'xxx' group by plan_line_id, plan_operation, plan_depth order by 1;
   ```

2. Observe the query result from top to bottom. The `LAST_ROW_EOF_TIME` value of operator 0 at the top level must be approximately the same as its `CLOSE_TIME` value. Assume that operator 0 is a `HASH JOIN` operator. During execution, it first collects all data from the left child operator to build a hash table, and then collects data from the right child operator to probe the hash table row by row. In this case, check the `LAST_ROW_EOF_TIME` value of operator 1, which is the left child operator of the `HASH JOIN` operator.

   1. If the `LAST_ROW_EOF_TIME` value of operator 1 is large, the left branch of the `HASH JOIN` operator is executed most of the time. In this case, continue to observe subplans of operator 1.
   2. If the `LAST_ROW_EOF_TIME` value of operator 1 is small, the right branch of the `HASH JOIN` operator is executed and the hash table is probed most of the time. In this case, continue to observe subplans of the right child operator of operator 0.

The following plan is used as an example for analysis.

First, observe the operator at the top level, which is a `MERGE JOIN` operator. During execution, it fetches one row from the left child operator and then one row from the right child operator. The following query result shows that the operator was opened at the 25.792777 second, the left child operator of the `MERGE JOIN` operator returned the first row at 16:29:25.793831, and the right child operator of the `MERGE JOIN` operator returned the first row at 16:29:27.572661. The right branch of the `MERGE JOIN` operator takes more than one second to return the first row of data.

Then observe the right child operator of the `MERGE JOIN` operator, which is a `SORT` operator. During execution, the `SORT` operator receives all data from the lower layer, sorts the data, and then sends the sorted data to the upper layer. The `ROWSS` field indicates that the `SORT` operator collected 1.6 million rows of data. It will take a lot of time to sort the data. You can create an index on the sorting key to cancel sorting and improve performance.

To analyze performance issues based on the `GV$SQL_PLAN_MONITOR` view , you must familiarize yourself with execution modes of different operators. Execution modes of some common operators are described below.

1. Streaming mode: The operator sends data to the upper layer while collecting data from the lower layer.

   limit, merge group by, merge distinct, subplan scan

2. Blocking mode: The operator sends data to the upper layer after collecting all data from the lower layer.

   sort, hash group by, hash distinct, material

3. Other modes.

   | **Operator** | **Execution mode** |
   |---|---|
   | `MERGE JOIN`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT` | The operator simultaneously collects data from the two child operators by starting from the left child operator.  |
   | `NESTED-LOOP JOIN` or `SUBPLAN FILTER` | The operator collects data from the first child operator row by row and then rescans other child operators to collect data.  |
   | `HASH JOIN`, `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT` | The operator collects all data from the left child operator and then collects data from the right child operator.  |
