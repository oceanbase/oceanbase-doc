# Get started with OceanBase AP

This topic describes how to get started with OceanBase AP in OceanBase Database Community Edition. If you have only one server, you can quickly build a demo environment to deploy OceanBase Database. The demo database provides basic features for you to quickly learn about OceanBase Database, but does not support distributed capabilities or high availability. Therefore, long-term use is not recommended.

## Step 1: Build an experience environment

1. Download and install the all-in-one package.

   Download the all-in-one package for the Community Edition from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) and upload it to any directory on your server.

2. In the directory where the package is located, run the following commands to decompress and install the package:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ tar -xzf oceanbase-all-in-one-*.tar.gz
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./install.sh
   [admin@test001 bin]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

3. Run the following command to deploy OceanBase Database:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd demo
   ```

   By default, the `obd demo` command deploys OceanBase Database and its components with minimum specifications in the home directory on your server and then starts them. The components include OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), OBAgent, Grafana, and Prometheus. The name of the deployed cluster is fixed to `demo`.

    <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>If you install Grafana or Prometheus, its access address is returned in the command output. On Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the program may fail to obtain a public IP address but return an intranet IP address. You must use a correct public IP address. </p>
    </main>

4. Run the connection command in the output to connect to the database.

   After the `obd demo` command succeeds, you will find the command for connecting to OceanBase Database through OBClient. The examples are as follows:

   * Directly connect to the database through port 2881

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2881 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A
      ```

   * Connect to the database in proxy mode through ODP

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2883 -uroot@sys -Doceanbase -A
      ```

5. (Optional) Configure the password.

   After you deploy OceanBase Database by using the `obd demo` command, you can follow the steps below to configure a password for the demo cluster.

   1. Modify the configuration file.

        ```shell
        obd cluster edit-config demo
        ```

        After you run the preceding command to open the configuration file, add `root_password: xxxx` in the `oceanbase-ce` (Community Edition) or `oceanbase` (Enterprise Edition) section in the configuration file. Then save the file and exit. Here is an example:

        ```yaml
        oceanbase-ce:
          servers:
            - 127.0.0.1
          global:
            home_path: /home/admin/oceanbase-ce
            ... # Some parameters are omitted here.
            log_disk_size: 13G
            root_password: ******
        ```

   2. Restart the cluster.

        After you modify and save the configuration file, obd will output the restart command. You can directly copy and run it. Here is an example:  

        ```shell
        [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster edit-config demo
        Search param plugin and load ok
        Search param plugin and load ok
        Parameter check ok
        Save deploy "demo" configuration
        Use `obd cluster reload demo` to make changes take effect.
        Trace ID: 29dd12fa-3d73-11ee-91bc-00163e01cd7a
        If you want to view detailed obd logs, please run: obd display-trace 29dd12fa-3d73-11ee-91bc-00163e01cd7a
        ```

        The output shows that you must run the `obd cluster reload demo` command to restart the `demo` cluster after you modify the password for the `root@sys` user in the configuration file.  

## Step 2: Create a table

1. Create a database.

   Use the `CREATE DATABASE` statement to create a database.

   For example, create a database named `quickstart`, set the character set to `utf8mb4`, and specify the read and write attributes.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE DATABASE quickstart DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 READ WRITE;
   Query OK, 1 row affected
   ```

2. Create a table.

   Use the `CREATE TABLE` statement to create a table in the database.

   For example, create a table named `test` in the `quickstart` database.

   ```sql
   obclient> USE quickstart;
   Database changed

   obclient> CREATE TABLE test (place VARCHAR(500), latitude VARCHAR(50),longitude  VARCHAR(50), country  VARCHAR(1000), continent  VARCHAR(100), magnitude DECIMAL(3, 1));
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

## Step 3: Import data

The sample dataset used in this topic is sourced from the `earthquake_dataset.csv` file in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vizeno/earthquake-data-overview).

1. Download the `earthquake_dataset.csv` file from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vizeno/earthquake-data-overview).

2. Copy the `earthquake_dataset.csv` file to the server where the OBServer node resides.

   ```yaml
   scp earthquake_dataset.csv admin@10.10.10.1:/home/admin/test_data
   ```

3. Log on to the server where the OBServer node to connect to resides.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   ssh admin@10.10.10.1
   ```

4. Set the path where the file to be imported is located.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>For security reasons, when you set the system variable <code>secure_file_priv</code>, you can connect to the database only through a local socket to execute the SQL statement that modifies the global variable. For more information, see <a href="https://www.oceanbase.com/docs/common-oceanbase-database-cn-1000000000821297">secure_file_priv</a>. </p>
    </main>

   Here is an example:

    1. Log on to the server where the OBServer node to connect to resides.  

         ```shell
         ssh admin@10.10.10.1
         ```

    2. Run the following command to connect to the `mysql001` tenant through a local Unix socket:

         Here is an example:

         ```shell
         obclient -S /home/admin/oceanbase/run/sql.sock -uroot@mysql001 -p******
         ```

    3. Set the file directory to `/`, which indicates that any path can be accessed.  

         ```sql
         SET GLOBAL SECURE_FILE_PRIV = "/";
         ```

5. Reconnect to the database.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -A
   ```

6. Use the `LOAD DATA` statement to import data.

   Here is an example:

   Execute the following `LOAD DATA` statement to load data from the specified file to a data table. In this statement:
   
   - Set the path and name of the file to be loaded to `/home/admin/test_data/earthquake_dataset.csv`.
   - Set the name of the destination table to which the data is to be loaded to `test`.
   - Specify comma (,) as the delimiter for fields in the data file.
   - Specify to enclose fields (of the character type) in the data file by using double quotation marks (").
   - Specify to use line breaks as the end characters of lines in the data file.
   - Specify the mappings between columns in the source data file and those in the destination table. The first column in the data file will be mapped to the `place` column in the destination table, the second column to the `latitude` column, the third column to the `longitude` column, and so on.

   ```shell
   obclient [test]> LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '/home/admin/test_data/earthquake_dataset.csv'
       INTO TABLE test
       FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
       ENCLOSED BY '"'
       LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
       IGNORE 1 LINES
       (place,latitude,longitude,country,continent,magnitude);
   ```

## Step 4: Query and analyze data

1. Log on to the server where the OBServer node to connect to resides.

   ```shell
   ssh admin@10.10.10.1
   ```

2. Connect to the database.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient -h127.0.0.1 -P2881 -utest_user001@mysql001 -p****** -A
   ```

3. Query data of a specific place.

   ```sql
   obclient [quickstart]> select * from test where place = 'Santiago';
   +----------+----------+-----------+---------+----------------+-----------+
   | place    | latitude | longitude | country | continent      | magnitude |
   +----------+----------+-----------+---------+----------------+-----------+
   | Santiago | -33.4463 | -70.6682  |  Chile  |  South America |       4.8 |
   | Santiago | -33.4521 | -70.6647  |  Chile  |  South America |       4.5 |
   | Santiago | -33.4505 | -70.6717  |  Chile  |  South America |       5.2 |
   | Santiago | -33.4489 | -70.6693  |  Chile  |  South America |       5.6 |
   | Santiago | -33.4472 | -70.6659  |  Chile  |  South America |       4.1 |
   +----------+----------+-----------+---------+----------------+-----------+
   5 rows in set
   ```

4. Count the number of earthquakes in each continent.

   ```sql
   obclient [quickstart]> select continent,count(*) from test group by continent;
   +----------------+----------+
   | continent      | count(*) |
   +----------------+----------+
   |  South America |       90 |
   |  Africa        |      580 |
   |  Antarctica    |       70 |
   |  North America |      190 |
   |  Oceania       |       45 |
   |  Asia          |      155 |
   |  Europe        |      135 |
   +----------------+----------+
   7 rows in set
   ```
