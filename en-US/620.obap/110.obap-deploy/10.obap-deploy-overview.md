# Overview

You can select an appropriate product edition, deployment solution, and deployment mode as needed.

## Select an appropriate product edition

OceanBase Database is available in two editions: OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-level, native distributed database independently developed by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware. Its groundbreaking deployment mode of "five IDCs across three regions" sets a new standard for automatic, lossless disaster recovery at the region level. OceanBase Database has also set new records in the TPC-C benchmark test, supporting more than 1,500 nodes in one cluster. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL.
* OceanBase Database Community Edition is an integrated database that supports both standalone and distributed deployment and that is compatible with MySQL. It is built on the native distributed architecture and supports enterprise-level features such as financial-grade high availability, transparent horizontal scaling, distributed transactions, multitenancy, and syntax compatibility. OceanBase Database Community Edition has an open-source kernel and provides open APIs and various eco-capabilities to meet the business requirements of enterprises or individuals.

For more information about the differences between the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition, see [Differences between the features of the Enterprise Edition and the Community Edition](../../100.learn-more-about-oceanbase/200.differences-between-enterprise-edition-and-community-edition.md).

## Select an appropriate deployment solution

OceanBase Database uses a shared-nothing architecture with multiple replicas to ensure zero single point of failure (SPOF) and system continuity. It supports high availability and disaster recovery at the node, Internet data center (IDC), and region levels. You can deploy OceanBase Database in a single IDC, in two IDCs in the same region, in three IDCs across two regions, or in five IDCs across three regions. You can also deploy the arbitration service to reduce costs.

For more information about each deployment solution, see [HA deployment solutions for OceanBase clusters](../../400.deploy/200.introduction-to-oceanbase-cluster-high-availability-deployment-scheme.md).

## Select an appropriate deployment mode

| **Product edition** | **Scenario** | **Recommended deployment mode** | **Deployment tool** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition** | Production environment | We recommend that you use OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to deploy an OceanBase cluster. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](../../400.deploy/300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/300.deploy-through-a-graphical-interface/300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/500.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters-use-ocp.md).  | OceanBase Admin Toolkit (OAT) and OCP |
| **OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition** | Non-production environment | You can use the command-line interface (CLI) to deploy an OceanBase cluster. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using the CLI](../../400.deploy/300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/400.deploy-through-the-command-line/200.deploy-the-oceanbase-cluster-command-line/400.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters.md).  | oat-cli |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Online environment | We recommend that you use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) for standard deployment. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy an OceanBase cluster through the GUI of OBD](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md).  | OBD |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Kubernetes environment | We recommend that you use ob-operator for deployment. <br/>For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database in a Kubernetes cluster](../../400.deploy/500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/300.deploy-in-the-k8s-cluster.md).  | ob-operator |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Quick experience with OceanBase Database in a non-natively supported operating system such as macOS or Windows | We recommend that you use a Docker image for deployment. <br/>For more information, see the **Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container** section in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).  |  |
| **OceanBase Database Community Edition** | Quick experience with OceanBase Database in a natively supported operating system such as Linux | We recommend that you use OBD for deployment. For more information, see the **Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment** or **Solution 2: Deploy OceanBase Database in a cluster** section in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).  | OBD |


## Plan your resources

After you select an appropriate deployment solution, you must plan and prepare the resources required for the deployment.

For more information about the configuration requirements for servers, see [Prepare servers](../../400.deploy/300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/200.preparations-before-deploy/100.prepare-servers.md).
