# Full direct load

After you import data to OceanBase Database in a regular way, you must perform a major compaction to improve query performance. However, after you import data to OceanBase Database in full direct load mode, you can achieve high query performance without a major compaction.

OceanBase Database supports full direct load and incremental direct load. Full direct load directly generates a major SSTable. The major SSTable for columnstore tables is directly generated in the columnar storage format to quickly respond to analytical processing (AP) queries. Incremental direct load writes data to SSTables in the row-based storage format. To improve the performance of AP queries, you must perform a major compaction to convert the data into the columnar storage format.

## Examples

1. Create a table.

   ```cpp
   OceanBase(root@test)>create table lineitem(
       l_orderkey           bigint(20) NOT NULL ,
       l_partkey            bigint(20) NOT NULL ,
       l_suppkey            bigint(20) NOT NULL ,
       l_linenumber         bigint(20) NOT NULL ,
       l_quantity           bigint(20) NOT NULL ,
       l_extendedprice      decimal(10,2) NOT NULL ,
       l_discount           decimal(10,2) NOT NULL ,
       l_tax                decimal(10,2) NOT NULL ,
       l_returnflag         char(1) ,
       l_linestatus         char(1) ,
       l_shipdate           date ,
       l_commitdate         date ,
       l_receiptdate        date ,
       l_shipinstruct       char(25) ,
       l_shipmode           char(10) ,
       l_comment            varchar(44),
   primary key(l_orderkey, l_linenumber)
   )  with column group (each column);
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```cpp
   Query OK, 0 row affected (0.08 sec)
   ```

2. Import data in incremental direct load mode.

   ```cpp
   OceanBase(root@test)>load data /*+ query_timeout(10000000000) parallel(64) direct(true,0,'inc_replace') */ infile '/path/to/lineitem.tbl' into table lineitem FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' enclosed BY '' ESCAPED BY '';
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```cpp
   Query OK, 59986052 rows affected (45.66 sec)
   Records: 59986052  Delected: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

3. Query data.

   ```cpp
   OceanBase(root@test)>select /*+ query_timeout(10000000000) */ count(*) from lineitem;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```cpp
   +----------+
   |  count(*)|
   +----------+
   | 59986052 |
   +----------+
   1 row in set (45.42 sec)
   ```

4. Truncate data.

   ```cpp
   OceanBase(root@test)>truncate lineitem;
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```cpp
   Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.05 sec)
   ```

5. Import data in full direct load mode.

   ```cpp
   OceanBase(root@test)>load data /*+ query_timeout(10000000000) parallel(64) direct(true,0) */ infile '/path/to/lineitem.tbl' into table lineitem FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|' enclosed BY '' ESCAPED BY '';
   ```

   The return result is as follows:

   ```cpp
   Query OK, 59986052 rows affected (1 min 3.83 sec)
   Records: 50086052  Deleted: 0  Skipped: 0  Warnings: 0
   ```

6. Query data.

   ```cpp
   OceanBase(root@test)>select /*+ query_timeout(10000000000) */ count(*) from lineitem;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```cpp
   +----------+
   |  count(*)|
   +----------+
   | 59986052 |
   +----------+
   1 row in set (0.01 sec)
   ```

After you import data in incremental direct load mode, the data query speed is lower than that achieved with columnstore tables. After you import data in full direct load mode, the data query speed can reach that achieved with columnstore tables.
