# Ecosystem integration

As a high-performance distributed relational database, OceanBase Database provides a comprehensive ecosystem that integrates many tools to simplify database management, improve operational efficiency, and seamlessly connect to a variety of IT environments. This topic describes data integration, orchestration, and visualization tools used in analytical processing (AP) scenarios.

## Data integration

Data integration is an IT process that integrates data from different sources into one view to support analysis, reporting, and business decision-making. Data can be scattered across multiple systems, such as relational databases, files, applications, NoSQL databases, and cloud storage services.

Change Data Capture (CDC) is an important technology in the data integration field to help you identify data that has changed since the last extraction. You can use the data obtained by using CDC to create history databases or perform near-real-time caching. You can also provide the data to message queues (MQs) and use the data for analysis and auditing.

The binlog service of OceanBase Database is compatible with MySQL binlogs. You can reuse the existing incremental parsing system for MySQL binlogs to synchronize incremental data of MySQL tenants of OceanBase Database without changing the existing data links. For more information about the binlog service, see [Binlog service](../700.reference/1500.Components-and-Tools/300.data-integrate/100.oblogproxy-overview.md).

OceanBase Database is compatible with mainstream data integration tools, including but not limited to those described in the following table.

## Orchestration

Orchestration tools in the data integration field are software tools that manage, schedule, and coordinate different data processing tasks and data processes. These tools provide advanced ways to organize and perform multiple data integration activities, such as data extract-transform-load (ETL) processes as well as data cleansing, verification, and publishing tasks.

## Observability

Observability is the ability to monitor, track, analyze, and interpret data processing flows and system status. High observability is crucial for complex data channels and systems. It allows the O&M team to identify and respond to any problems as soon as possible, to ensure system health and performance.

In addition, data quality is a key component of the data integration process and also requires high observability. Data quality observability tools allow the O&M team to verify data accuracy, consistency, and integrity, and check whether the data is as expected. This ensures that business decisions are made based on trusted data.

It is widely used to monitor the health of services and applications. | For more information, see [Integrate OCP monitoring into Prometheus](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/common-ocp-10000000001187482).  |

## Visualization

Visualization tools in the data integration field are software tools that display, interpret, and transmit data by using graphs and tables. These tools obtain data from data integration processes and transform the data into views. This way, you can gain insight into the trends and patterns behind the data even without in-depth technical knowledge.
