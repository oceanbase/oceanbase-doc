## View the currently connected database by using an SQL statement

### SQL statement

```sql
SELECT * FROM all_users;
```

### Examples

1. View all database users.

   ```sql
   obclient>SELECT * FROM all_users;
   +------------+------------------+-----------+
   | USERNAME   | USERID           | CREATED   |
   +------------+------------------+-----------+
   | LBACSYS    | 1100611139403783 | 16-MAY-22 |
   | ORAAUDITOR | 1100611139403784 | 16-MAY-22 |
   | PUBLIC     | 1100611139403781 | 16-MAY-22 |
   | SYS        | 1100611139403782 | 16-MAY-22 |
   +------------+------------------+-----------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

2. View the database and user of the current connection.

   ```sql
   obclient> SHOW PROCESSLIST;
   +------------+------+----------------------+------+---------+------+--------+------------------+
   | ID         | USER | HOST                 | DB   | COMMAND | TIME | STATE  | INFO             |
   +------------+------+----------------------+------+---------+------+--------+------------------+
   | 3221487786 | SYS  | 100.88.114.135:52340 | SYS  | Query   |    0 | ACTIVE | SHOW PROCESSLIST |
   +------------+------+----------------------+------+---------+------+--------+------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > In the preceding example, `SYS` in the `USER` column and `SYS` in the `DB` column are respectively the user and corresponding database of the current connection.
