# Connect to OceanBase Database by using Go MySQL Driver

This topic describes how to connect to OceanBase Database by using Go MySQL Driver.

## Install Go MySQL Driver

### Use the `go get` command to install Go MySQL Driver

If you use Go 1.13 to 1.16, you can run the following command to install Go MySQL Driver:

```bash
go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

For more information about Go MySQL Driver, see [Project description on Github](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).

### Use the `go install` command to install Go MySQL Driver

If you cannot use the `go get` command due to the version or network issues, you can perform the following steps to install Go MySQL Driver:

1. Clone the Go MySQL Driver repository from Github to the `/src` directory.

   ```bash
   cd /usr/local/go/src
   git clone https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql.git
   ```

2. Run the `go install` command.

   ```bash
   go install mysql
   ```

> **Notice**
>
> For some Go versions, the `go install` command cannot be executed in the `/src` directory. You can identify the correct directory based on the error returned after you run the `go install` command. For example, put the `mysql` folder in the `/src/vendor` directory and then run the `go install` command if the following error is returned: `cannot find package "mysql" in: /usr/local/go/src/vendor/mysql`.

## Use Go MySQL Driver

You can set the connection string in the format of `username:password@protocol(address)/dbname?param=value`.

The following sample code takes the `test.go` file as an example:

```go
package main

import (
    "database/sql"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql" // Specify the exact installation path of Go MySQL Driver. If it is installed in the /src directory, you can specify mysql as the path.
)

type City struct {
    Id         int
    Name       string
    Population int
}

func main() {
    select_all()
    }

func select_all() {
    conn := "root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:2881)/testdb"
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", conn)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    defer db.Close()

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    res, err := db.Query("SELECT * FROM cities")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    defer res.Close()

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    for res.Next() {

        var city City
        err := res.Scan(&city.Id, &city.Name, &city.Population)

        if err != nil {
            log.Fatal(err)
        }

        fmt.Printf("%v\n", city)
    }
}
```

Parameters

```go
conn := "{username}:{password}@tcp({hostname}:{port})/{dbname}"
```

* **username**: the connection account of the tenant. By default, the username of the tenant administrator is `root`.

* **password**: the password of the account.

* **hostname**: the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is usually the IP address of an OBProxy.

* **port**: the port for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is also the listening port of the OBProxy. Default value: 2883, which can be customized.

* **dbname**: the name of the database to be accessed.

Example: `conn := "root:@tcp(127.0.0.1:2881)/testdb"`

After you edit the code, run the following command:

```bash
// Specify the actual installation path of Go.
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

// Run the test.go file.
go run test.go

// Run the binary file after it is generated.
go build test.go
./test
```

### Troubleshoot the PreparedStatement error

If Go MySQL Driver returns a PreparedStatement error, log on to OceanBase Database as the root user and run the following command:

```bash
alter system set _ob_enable_prepared_statement = true;
```
