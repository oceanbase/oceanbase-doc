# Use the OBKV-Table Java client to connect to a cluster

OBKV-Table is an access pattern for the OBServer node introduced by OceanBase Database for the NoSQL scenario. This topic briefly describes how to use the ob_table_client_java client to call interfaces.

## Introduction to the client

Generally, at the application layer, OBServer nodes can be accessed through two modes: OBKV-Table and SQL, corresponding to the NoSQL and SQL modes, respectively.

In the NoSQL mode, the Java client ob_table_client_java communicates with OBServer nodes through the RPC protocol. Meanwhile, the client supports a diverse range of operation functions, which can generally meet the requirements of most scenarios.

Compared with the SQL mode, OBKV-Table does not involve complex parsing of SQL syntax and semantics, or the generation of execution plans. However, it offers nearly equal transaction and storage capabilities as the SQL mode, making it relatively simple to use. The overall process diagram is as follows:

## Preparations

Before using the OBKV-Table client to connect to the OBKV-Table cluster for data processing, ensure that you have completed the following work:

* Deployed an OceanBase cluster. For supported deployment plans, deployment methods, and detailed deployment procedures, see [Deployment overview](../../../400.deploy/100.deploy-overview.md).

* Created a MySQL tenant. For detailed instructions on creating a tenant, refer to [Create a tenant](../../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

* Created a database. For detailed instructions on creating a database, refer to [Create a database](../../../700.reference/300.database-object-management/100.manage-object-of-mysql-mode/100.manage-databases-of-mysql-mode/100.to-create-a-database-of-mysql-mode.md).

* Created an OBKV-Table data table. For detailed instructions on creating an OBKV-Table data table, refer to [OBKV-Table data models](../100.introduction-to-tableapi/300.tableapi-data-models.md).

Below is a table creation example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `test_varchar_table_00` (
    `c1` varchar(20) NOT NULL,
    `c2` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
    `c3` varchar(20) DEFAULT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (`c1`)
);
```

### Import maven obkv-table-client dependencies

Log on to the [obkv-table-client-java repository](https://github.com/oceanbase/obkv-table-client-java), download the latest client, and add it to the pom.xml file.


## What to do next

* Depending on requirements, you can configure relevant parameters for the client. For detailed information about the parameters, refer to [Set client parameters](../200.use-of-the-tableapi-client/200.set-client-parameters.md).

* Utilize the client to operate on data through the supported interfaces. For detailed information about the interfaces, refer to [Supported client interfaces](../200.use-of-the-tableapi-client/210.obkv-table-interfaces.md).

* For more information about how to use the client, see [Use the OBKV-Table Java client](../200.use-of-the-tableapi-client/300.an-example-of-client-use.md).
