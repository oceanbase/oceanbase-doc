# Differences between replace and insert_or_update

`replace` and `insert_or_update` are two operations that can be easily confused. In many cases, they may appear to have the same behavior externally, but their underlying semantics differ. This topic will provide a detailed explanation of the differences between the two.

`replace` represents an insertion operation. When conflicts occur, it deletes all rows causing conflicts and then performs the insertion.

`insert_or_update` also represents an insertion operation. However, when conflicts occur, it performs an update operation instead.

Let's illustrate the differences between the two with examples.

## insert_or_update

The `insert_or_update` operation provided by OBKV-Table is equivalent to a special SQL syntax. The following example shows how `insert_or_update` works:

```sql
OceanBase (root@test)> desc test_replace;
+-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| c1    | int(11) | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| c2    | int(11) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
| c3    | int(11) | YES  | UNI | NULL    |       |
+-------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 |    5 |    6 |
+----+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.03 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> insert into test_replace (c1, c2, c3) values (4, 7, 8), (5, 8, 9) on duplicate key update c1=values(c1), c2=values(c2), c3=values(c3);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.03 sec)
Records: 2  Duplicates: 1  Warnings: 0

OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 |    7 |    8 |
|  5 |    8 |    9 |
+----+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)
```

## replace

```sql
OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 |    7 |    8 |
|  5 |    8 |    9 |
+----+------+------+
3 rows in set (0.03 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> replace into test_replace (c1, c3) values (4, 9);
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.04 sec)

OceanBase (root@test)> select * from test_replace;
+----+------+------+
| c1 | c2   | c3   |
+----+------+------+
|  1 |    2 |    3 |
|  4 | NULL |    9 |
+----+------+------+
2 rows in set (0.02 sec)
```

Based on the preceding examples, unlike `insert_or_update`, the `replace` operation deletes rows and changes the value of `c2` in the row where `c1` is `4` to the default value `NULL` because of the insertion of a new value. The `insert_or_update` operation does not perform these two special actions. In most cases, you need to use the `insert_or_update` operation, which is similar to the put method in NoSQL mode.

The two operations achieve the same results in the following two circumstances:

* The table only has the primary key but no unique indexes.

* The operation specifies the values of all columns in a row and the system does not need to insert the default value for columns where values are missing.

Although the results are the same in the preceding two circumstances, OBKV-Table optimizes the implementation of `insert_or_update` to provide better performance than that of replace.
