## Q: What should I do when the error [OB_NOT_SUPPORTED][each Table has not one Family currently not supported] is returned?

A: At present, OBKV-HBase supports only one column family. More column families will be supported in later versions. When this error is returned, check whether any table group is bound with multiple tables. For more information, see [Query information about a table group](../../700.reference/300.database-object-management/100.manage-object-of-mysql-mode/400.manage-table-groups-of-mysql-mode/300.view-the-information-of-a-table-group-of-mysql-mode.md).
