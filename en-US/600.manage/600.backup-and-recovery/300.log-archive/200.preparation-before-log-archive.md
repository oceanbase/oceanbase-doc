# Preparations

This topic describes the preparations for log archiving.

## (Optional) Configure the log archiving concurrency

Before you enable the archiving mode for a tenant, you can configure the log archiving concurrency to accelerate log archiving for the tenant.

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

2. Configure the `log_archive_concurrency` parameter by using a proper statement.

   The tenant-level parameter `log_archive_concurrency` specifies the total number of worker threads for log archiving. The modification of this parameter takes effect immediately without restarting the OBServer node. The value range of this parameter is [0, 100]. The default value is `0`, which means using the adaptive log archiving concurrency of OceanBase Database. We recommend that you use the default value.

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>If the tenant is configured with two or four CPU cores, we recommend that you use the default value. </p>
   </main>

   Methods for adjusting the log archiving concurrency are as follows:

   * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant to adjust the log archiving concurrency of a specified tenant:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET log_archive_concurrency = 10 TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant to adjust the log archiving concurrency of all tenants:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET log_archive_concurrency = 10 TENANT = all_user;
      ```

      or

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET log_archive_concurrency = 10 TENANT = all;
      ```

     <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>Starting from OceanBase Database V4.2.1, <code>TENANT = all_user</code> and <code>TENANT = all</code> express the same semantics. If you want an operation to take effect on all user tenants, we recommend that you use <code>TENANT = all_user</code>. <code>TENANT = all</code> will be deprecated. </p>
     </main>

   * Execute the following statement in a user tenant to adjust its log archiving concurrency:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET log_archive_concurrency = 10;
      ```

   For more information about the `log_archive_concurrency` parameter, see [log_archive_concurrency](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/25000.log_archive_concurrency.md).

## Configure the archive destination

Before you initiate a log archiving job, you must execute the `ALTER SYSTEM` statement to configure the `LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST` parameter. The `sys` tenant is used for managing clusters and does not contain user data or support backup or restore. Therefore, you do not need to configure an archive destination for the `sys` tenant.

Set the `LOCATION`, `BINDING`, and `PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL` attributes of the archive destination.

### Considerations

Make sure that the archive path for each tenant is a separate empty directory. You cannot configure the same archive path for different tenants.

### Procedure

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The administrator user of a MySQL tenant is <code>root</code> and that of an Oracle tenant is <code>SYS</code>. </p>
   </main>

2. Configure the archive destination.

   * Configure the archive destination for a specified tenant in the `sys` tenant

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=archive_path [BINDING=archive_mode] [PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL=piece_switch_interval]' TENANT = tenant_name;
      ```

   * Configure the archive destination for a user tenant from the current tenant

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=archive_path [BINDING=archive_mode] [PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL=piece_switch_interval]';
      ```

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>After upgrading OceanBase Database from V4.0.x to V4.1.0, it is necessary to change the archive path. However, when upgrading from V4.1.x to V4.2.x, there is no need to change the archive path. Moreover, during the upgrade process from V4.1.x to V4.2.x, you have the option to archive logs. </p>
   </main>

   The details are as follows:

   * (Required) Set `LOCATION`.

      The `LOCATION` attribute specifies the archive destination. OceanBase Database allows you to use the following types of media as the archive destination: Network File System (NFS), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3).

      :::tab
      tab OSS

      When you use OSS as the archive destination, besides the archive path and the `host`, `access_key`, and `access_id` parameters, you can also set the `delete_mode` parameter to configure the cleanup mode for archive files.

      The `delete_mode` parameter has two values: `delete` and `tagging`. If you do not specify this parameter, the default value `delete` takes effect.

      * `delete`: The archive files that meet the cleanup requirements are directly deleted.

         In this mode, when you enable automatic cleanup for archive files in automatic mode, the system directly deletes the archive files that meet the requirements.

        <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>This is the default cleanup mode. If you do not specify <code>delete_mode</code>, the default cleanup mode <code>delete</code> takes effect. </p>
        </main>

      * `tagging`: The archive files that meet the cleanup requirements are tagged and retained.

         In this mode, when you enable automatic cleanup for archive files, the system directly tags the archive files that meet the cleanup requirements. The key of the tag is `delete_mode` and the value is `tagging`. This way, you can manage the lifecycle of these files on OSS based on the tag.

      To set OSS as the archive destination and configure the `delete` cleanup mode for the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/archive?
      host=***.aliyun-inc.com
      &access_id=***
      &access_key=***
      &delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      To set OSS as the archive destination and configure the `delete` cleanup mode for the current user tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/archive?
      host=***.aliyun-inc.com
      &access_id=***
      &access_key=***
      &delete_mode=delete';
      ```

      Here, `oss://` indicates that OSS is used as the archive destination, the storage bucket name is `oceanbase-test-bucket`, the path in the storage bucket is `/backup/archive`, and `?` is used to separate other parameters of the path. The `host` parameter specifies the host address of the storage bucket. The `access_id` and `access_key` parameters specify the access key of OSS. The cleanup mode is set to `delete`.

      For more information about the automatic cleanup of archived data in `delete` or `tagging` mode, see [Automatic cleanup of archived data](../500.clear-backup-data/100.cleaning-up-backed-up-data-automatically.md).

      tab NFS

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>When you use NFS as the archive destination, note that:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The value of <code>LOCATION</code> cannot be a string with a question mark (?). </li>
      <li>The value of <code>LOCATION</code> must be an absolute path, and the OBServer node must have read and write privileges on the destination specified by <code>LOCATION</code>. </li>
      <li>Ensure that all OBServer nodes are mounted to NFS of the same server and use the parameter settings recommended in this topic. For more information about the procedure of deploying NFS, see <a href="../200.deploy-nfs.md">Deploy the NFS client</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      To set NFS as the archive destination for the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      To set NFS as the archive destination for the current user tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive';
      ```

      Here, `file://` indicates that NFS is used as the archive destination, and the archive path is `/data/nfs/backup/archive`.

      tab COS

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>If you use COS as the archive destination, note that:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The list cache of the bucket must be disabled. Otherwise, a backup inconsistency error occurs. For guidance on how to disable the list cache of a bucket, contact the technical support of COS. </li>
      <li>To use the APPEND Object API for a bucket, you must disable the multi-AZ feature. If the multi-AZ feature is enabled, an error is reported during archiving. </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      COS also allows you to configure the cleanup mode of archive files by using the `delete_mode` parameter in the same way as with OSS.

      * To set COS as the archive destination and configure the `delete` cleanup mode for the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statement:

        ```sql
        obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=cos://oceanbase-test-appid/backup/archive?
        host=cos.ap-***.myqcloud.com
        &access_id=***
        &access_key=***&appid=***
        &delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
        ```

      * To set COS as the archive destination and configure the `delete` cleanup mode for the current user tenant, execute the following statement:

        ```sql
        obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=cos://oceanbase-test-appid/backup/archive?
        host=cos.ap-***.myqcloud.com
        &access_id=***
        &access_key=***&appid=***
        &delete_mode=delete';
        ```

      Here, `cos://` indicates that COS is used as the archive destination, the storage bucket name is `oceanbase-test-appid`, the path in the storage bucket is `/backup/archive`, and `?` is used to separate other parameters of the path. The `host` parameter specifies the host address of the storage bucket, that is, the endpoint (without the bucket name) of the bucket. The `access_id` and `access_key` parameters specify the access key of COS. The `appid` parameter is required, and it specifies the APPID of the Tencent Cloud account. The cleanup mode is set to `delete`.

      tab S3

      S3 also allows you to configure the cleanup mode of archive files by using the `delete_mode` parameter in the same way as with OSS and COS.

      * To set S3 as the archive destination and configure the `delete` cleanup mode for the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the sys tenant, execute the following statement:

        ```sql
        obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=s3://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/archive?
        host=s3.<region>.amazonaws.com
        &access_id=******
        &access_key=******
        &s3_region=******
        &delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
        ```

      * To set S3 as the archive destination and configure the `delete` cleanup mode for the current user tenant, execute the following statement:

        ```sql
        obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=s3://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/archive?
        host=s3.<region>.amazonaws.com
        &access_id=******
        &access_key=******
        &s3_region=******
        &delete_mode=delete';
        ```

      Here, `s3://` indicates that S3 is used as the archive destination, the storage bucket name is `oceanbase-test-bucket`, the path in the storage bucket is `/backup/archive`, and `?` is used to separate other parameters of the path. The `host` parameter specifies the domain name of the S3 service. The `access_id` and `access_key` parameters specify the access key of AWS services. The `s3_region` parameter is required, and it specifies the region where the S3 storage bucket is located. The cleanup mode is set to `delete`.

      :::

   * (Optional) Set the `BINDING` attribute.

      The `BINDING` attribute specifies the prioritizing mode for archiving and businesses. The `BINDING` attribute has two values: `Optional` and `Mandatory`. If you do not specify this attribute, the default value `Optional` takes effect.

      * The `Optional` mode prioritizes user businesses. In this mode, when log archiving falls behind log generation, logs may be recycled before being archived. This causes an interruption.

      * The `Mandatory` mode prioritizes archiving. In this mode, you may be unable to write more data before existing data is archived.

      To set NFS as the archive destination and set the `BINDING` attribute for the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive BINDING=Optional' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      To set NFS as the archive destination and set the `BINDING` attribute for the current user tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive BINDING=Optional';
      ```

   * (Optional) Set the `PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL` attribute.

      The `PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL` attribute specifies the switching interval for pieces. The value range is `[1d, 7d]`. If you do not specify this attribute, the default value `1d` takes effect.

      To set NFS as the archive destination and configure to generate a log piece every other day for the `mysql_tenant` tenant in the `sys` tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive BINDING=Optional PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL=1d' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      To set NFS as the archive destination and configure to generate a log piece every other day for the current user tenant, execute the following statement:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST='LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive BINDING=Optional PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL=1d';
      ```

3. Query parameter settings from a view.

   You can query parameter settings from the `CDB_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST` view in the `sys` tenant or from the `DBA_OB_ARCHIVE_DEST` view in a user tenant. For more information, see [View the archiving parameter settings](../300.log-archive/800.view-parameters-of-log-archive.md).

### Considerations

After you configure the `LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST` parameter, by default, the system creates a file named `format` in the directory to which the specified destination belongs. This file is used to verify the validity information of the archive destination and ensure the integrity of data in the destination. Therefore, observe the following considerations when you configure the log archive destination:

* If the `format` file does not exist, the directory where the configured destination is located must be empty so that the `LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST` parameter can be set. If this directory is not empty, the system returns the `-9080` error to indicate that the `format` file does not exist.

* If the `format` file exists, its content must be verified so that the parameter can be set. Otherwise, the system returns the `-9081` error, indicating that the types of the cluster, tenant, and backup destination in the `format` file do not match those of the current cluster, tenant, and backup destination.

* When you execute a backup job, the job fails to be initiated if the `format` file does not exist or fails the verification.

In addition, incremental configuration is not supported after the archive destination is configured. Assume that the `BINDING` attribute is set to `Mandatory` and the `PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL` attribute is set to `1d` for the archive path `/data/nfs/backup/archive` in NFS. To change the value of `PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL` to `2d` and keep the setting of the `BINDING` attribute to `Mandatory`, you still need to specify the values of other attributes in the statement. If you do not specify a value for an attribute, the default value is used for the attribute.

Execute the following statement to modify the attribute settings.

* Modify the attribute settings for a specified tenant in the `sys` tenant

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST = 'LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive BINDING=Mandatory PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL=2d' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
   ```

* Modify the attribute settings for the current user tenant

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST = 'LOCATION=file:///data/nfs/backup/archive BINDING=Mandatory PIECE_SWITCH_INTERVAL=2d';
   ```

## Configure the archive lag

OceanBase Database uses the tenant-level parameter `archive_lag_target` to determine the duration that the system waits before archiving log data. This parameter supports units of milliseconds (ms), seconds (s), minutes (m), and hours (h), with a default value of 2 minutes. It specifies the maximum time interval between two consecutive archiving I/O operations, ensuring that online logs are promptly archived to mitigate the risk of data loss.

The database performs archiving on a per-log stream basis. When the current log stream has ongoing log writes and the time since the last archiving action exceeds the interval specified by the `archive_lag_target` parameter, the log stream initiates an archiving operation to process any unread logs.

For example, if the parameter is configured as `archive_lag_target='120s'` (equivalent to 2 minutes), the system will try to archive data within each log stream at 2-minute intervals, unless specific conditions, such as a full log archiving buffer, are met. This ensures that the time between consecutive archiving operations for the log stream remains under 2 minutes. Note that when the `archive_lag_target` parameter is set to `0`, the system will perform nearly real-time archiving.

For more information about the `archive_lag_target` parameter, see [archive_lag_target](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/7200.archive_lag_target.md).

### Prerequisites

Before modifying the value of the `archive_lag_target` parameter, ensure that the configuration of the archiving destination has been completed. Otherwise, the system will prompt the message `log_archive_dest has not been set, set archive_lag_target is not allowed` when attempting to modify the value of the `archive_lag_target` parameter.

### Considerations

* For scenarios where the archiving medium is OSS, NFS, or COS, the value of the `archive_lag_target` parameter can be set to any value within the specified range. However, for scenarios where the archiving medium is S3, the value of the `archive_lag_target` parameter cannot be less than `60s`. Otherwise, the system will generate an error.

* We recommend that you set the `archive_lag_target` parameter to a reasonable value to avoid excessive impact on system performance due to frequent I/O operations, especially when using object storage. At the same time, a value set too high may not meet the timeliness requirements for data recovery. Therefore, it is necessary to balance the RPO based on specific business needs and the performance of the archiving medium.

### Procedure

1. Log on to the database as the tenant administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

2. Choose the appropriate statement to configure the archive lag based on the specific scenario. The configuration methods are as follows:

   * To configure the archive lag time for a specific tenant as the `sys` tenant, execute the following statement:

     ```shell
     obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET archive_lag_target = '120s' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
     ```

     <main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <p>When configuring the <code>archive_lag_target</code> parameter, the <code>sys</code> tenant is not allowed to specify all user tenants using <code>TENANT = all_user</code>.</p>

   * To configure the archive lag time for the current tenant as a user tenant, execute the following statements:

     ```shell
     obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET archive_lag_target = '120s';
     ```
