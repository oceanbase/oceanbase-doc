# Parameters related to physical restore

This topic describes the parameters in restore statements.

## Parameters in the RESTORE statements

### Syntax

* Restore to a specified timestamp

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri UNTIL TIME='timestamp' WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password'] [DESCRIPTION [=] description];
   ```

* Restore to a specified system change number (SCN)

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri UNTIL SCN=scn WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password']  [DESCRIPTION [=] description];
   ```

* Restore to the latest timestamp

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password'] [DESCRIPTION [=] description];
   ```

* Cancel the restore of a tenant

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL RESTORE dest_tenant_name;
   ```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dest_tenant_name | The name of the target tenant to which the data is to be restored.  |
| uri | The data backup path `backup_data_dest` and log archive path `log_archive_dest` specified during restore. The value must contain at least one data backup path and one log archive path that are separated with a comma (`,`).  |
| timestamp | The timestamp to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`). The value of `timestamp` must be in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF` format. The fractional part (`FF`) supports 0 to 6 decimal places accurate to microseconds.  |
| scn | The SCN to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`).  |
| restore_option | The restore options, including `pool_list`, `locality`, `primary_zone`, and `concurrency`. Separate the options with ampersands (`&`). We recommend that you set `locality` and `primary_zone` to the same values as those of the source tenant. Otherwise, load balancing may be performed after the tenant is restored and activated as the primary tenant, which compromises the performance.  <ul><li>`pool_list`: required. The name of the resource pool created for the tenant to be restored. Multiple resource pools must be separated with commas (,). </li>  <li>`locality`: optional. The locality of replicas of the tenant to be restored, which must match the zone information of `pool_list` of the cluster where the tenant is located. </br>To ensure homogeneity with the source tenant, we recommend that you set the number of full-featured replicas of the tenant to the same as that of the source tenant. </br>By default, if this parameter is not specified, a full-featured replica is set for each zone in `zone_list` of the resource pool. </br>Example: `locality='F@z1,F@z2,F@z3'` <li>`primary_zone`: optional. The preferred position of the leader of the tenant to be restored, which must match the settings of `pool_list` and `locality`. In other words, the value of this parameter must match the zone information and meet the requirement that the primary region have at least two Paxos members. </br>To ensure homogeneity with the source tenant, we recommend that you set the number of primary zones with the top priority of the tenant to the same as that of the source tenant. </br>If this parameter is not specified, the system randomly distributes leaders in the zones specified by `zone_list` of `locality`.  </br>Example: `primary_zone='z1'`</li> <li>`concurrency`: optional. The degree of parallelism (DOP) for data restore. If `concurrency` is not specified, the `MAX_CPU` value assigned to the tenant is used as the default value. </br>Example: `concurrency=50`.</li></ul> |
| WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password' | The key backup information of the encrypted tenant. You need to specify the key backup information for a tenant restore only when the tenant is configured with transparent encryption. The parameter are described as follows:<ul><li><code>backup_key_path</code>: the backup path of the key. </li> <li><code>password</code>: the password that you set when you backed up the key. </li></ul> |
| description | The description. This parameter is optional.  |

### Constraint for specifying the timestamp and SCN

The timestamp and SCN must be greater than or equal to the minimum restore SCN indicated by `MIN_RESTORE_SCN` in the data backup view `CDB_OB_BACKUP_SET_FILES`, and smaller than or equal to the maximum archive SCN indicated by `CHECKPOINT_SCN` in the log archive view `CDB_OB_ARCHIVE_LOG`. Log archiving may be interrupted. Therefore, you must consider inconsecutive ranges of logs when you specify the restore SCN. The restorable window may be discontinuous.

Assume that:

* Two log archive rounds were initiated, with the `round_id` values of `1` and `2`.

* Three data backup jobs were initiated, which produced three valid data backup sets: `full_backup_set_1`, `full_backup_set_2`, and `inc_backup_set_3`.

The following figure shows the restorable window for physical restore. The right boundary of a data backup set is specified by `MIN_RESTORE_SCN`. For example, `MIN_RESTORE_SCN` of `full_backup_set_1` corresponds to `scn 300` in the figure. The right boundary of a log archive is specified by `CHECKPOINT_SCN`. For example, `CHECKPOINT_SCN` of `round 1` corresponds to `scn 500` in the figure.

Log archiving may be interrupted. Therefore, you must consider the inconsecutive time ranges when you calculate the restorable window. As a result, the restorable window is discontinuous. In the figure, the restorable window is `[scn 300, scn 500] \âˆª [scn 900, scn 1500]`.

## Parameters in the restore performance tuning statement

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET ha_high_thread_score =10 TENANT = mysql;
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ha_high_thread_score | The number of worker threads for the restore job queue.  |

## Parameters in the RECOVER statements

### Syntax

* Replay logs to the specified timestamp

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY [TENANT [=] tenant_name] UNTIL TIME='timestamp';
   ```

* Replay logs to the specified SCN

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY [TENANT [=] tenant_name] UNTIL SCN=scn;
   ```

* Continuously replay logs from the archive source without specifying the end point

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY [TENANT [=] tenant_name] UNTIL UNLIMITED;
   ```

* Cancel a log replay

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT [=] tenant_name CANCEL;
   ```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the tenant. |
| timestamp | The timestamp to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`). The value of `timestamp` must be in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF` format. The fractional part (`FF`) supports 0 to 6 decimal places, accurate to microseconds.  |
| scn | The SCN to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`).  |
| UNLIMITED | Specifies to continuously replay logs from the archive source without specifying the end point.  |

## Parameters in the ACTIVATE STANDBY statement

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ACTIVATE STANDBY TENANT tenant_name;
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the standby tenant that is restored. You can use this statement to change the role of only one tenant at a time.  |
