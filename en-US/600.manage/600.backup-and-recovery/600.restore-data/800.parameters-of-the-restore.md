# Parameters related to physical restore

This topic describes the parameters in restore statements.

## Parameters in the RESTORE statements

### Syntax

* Restore to a specified timestamp:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri UNTIL TIME='timestamp' WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password'] [DESCRIPTION description];
   ```

* Restore to a specified SCN:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri UNTIL SCN=scn WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password']  [DESCRIPTION description];
   ```

* Restore to the latest checkpoint:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE dest_tenant_name FROM uri WITH 'restore_option' [WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password'] [DESCRIPTION description];
   ```

* Cancel the restore of a tenant:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL RESTORE dest_tenant_name;
   ```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dest_tenant_name | The name of the target tenant to which the data is to be restored.  |
| uri | The data backup path `backup_data_dest` and log archive path `log_archive_dest` specified during restore. The value must contain at least one data backup path and one log archive path that are separated with a comma (`,`).  |
| timestamp | The timestamp to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`). The timestamp must be in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF` format, accurate to nanoseconds.  |
| scn | The SCN to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`).  |
| restore_option | The restore options, including `pool_list`, `locality`, `primary_zone`, and `concurrency`. Separate the options with ampersands (`&`). <ul><li>`pool_list`: (Required) The resource pool of the tenant. Multiple resource pools must be separated with commas (,). </li>  <li>`locality`: (Optional) The locality of replicas of the new tenant, which must match the zone information of `pool_list` of the cluster where the new tenant is located.  By default, if this option is not specified, a full-featured replica is set for each zone in `zone_list` of the resource pool. </br>For example, `locality='F@z1,F@z2,F@z3'`. <li> `primary_zone`: (Optional) The preferred position of the leader of the new tenant, which must match the settings of `pool_list` and `locality`. In other words, it must match the zone information and meet the constraint that `primary_region` must have at least two Paxos members. If this parameter is not specified, the system randomly distributes leaders in the zones specified by `zone_list` of `locality`.  </br>For example, `primary_zone='z1'`.</li> <li>`concurrency`: (Optional) The restore concurrency. If `concurrency` is not specified, the `MAX_CPU` value assigned to the tenant is used as the default value. </br>For example, `concurrency=50`.</li></ul> |
| WITH KEY FROM 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password' | Specifies the backup information of the key for encrypting the tenant. You need to specify the related information for key backup during restore only when transparent encryption is configured for the source tenant. The parameters are described as follows:<ul><li><code>backup_key_path</code>: the backup path for the key. </li> <li><code>password</code>: the encryption password specified during key backup. </li></ul> |
| description | The description. This parameter is optional.  |

### Constraint for specifying the timestamp and SCN

The timestamp and SCN must be greater than or equal to the minimum restore SCN indicated by `MIN_RESTORE_SCN` in the data backup view `CDB_OB_BACKUP_SET_FILES`, and smaller than or equal to the maximum archive SCN indicated by `CHECKPOINT_SCN` in the log archive view `CDB_OB_ARCHIVE_LOG`. Log archiving may be interrupted. Therefore, you must consider inconsecutive ranges of logs when you specify the restore SCN. The restorable window may be discontinuous.

Assume that:

* Two log archive rounds were initiated, with the `round_id` values of `1` and `2`.

* Three data backup jobs were initiated, which produced three valid data backup sets: `full_backup_set_1`, `full_backup_set_2`, and `inc_backup_set_3`.

The following figure shows the restorable window for physical restore. The right boundary of a data backup set is specified by `MIN_RESTORE_SCN`. For example, `MIN_RESTORE_SCN` of `full_backup_set_1` corresponds to `scn 300` in the figure. The right boundary of a log archive is specified by `CHECKPOINT_SCN`. For example, `CHECKPOINT_SCN` of `round 1` corresponds to `scn 500` in the figure.

Log archiving may be interrupted. Therefore, you must consider the inconsecutive time ranges when you calculate the restorable window. As a result, the restorable window is discontinuous. In the figure, the restorable window is `[scn 300, scn 500] u [scn 900, scn 1500]`.

## Parameters in the restore performance tuning statement

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET ha_high_thread_score =10 TENANT = mysql;
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| ha_high_thread_score | The weight of threads for the restore job queue.  |

## Parameters in the RECOVER statements

### Syntax

* Replay logs to the specified timestamp:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY [TENANT tenant_name] UNTIL TIME='timestamp';
   ```

* Replay logs to the specified SCN:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY [TENANT tenant_name] UNTIL SCN=scn;
   ```

* Continuously replay logs from the archive source without specifying the end point:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY [TENANT tenant_name] UNTIL UNLIMITED;
   ```

* Cancel a log replay:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER STANDBY TENANT tenant_name CANCEL;
   ```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| tenant_name | The tenant name. |
| timestamp | The timestamp to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`). The timestamp must be in the `YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS.FF` format, accurate to nanoseconds.  |
| scn | The SCN to which data is restored. Join the parameter name and value with an equal sign (`=`).  |
| UNLIMITED | Specifies to continuously replay logs from the archive source without specifying the end point.  |

## Parameters in the ACTIVATE statement

### Syntax

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM ACTIVATE STANDBY TENANT tenant_name;
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| tenant_name | The name of the standby tenant that is restored. You can use this statement to change the role of only one tenant at a time.  |
