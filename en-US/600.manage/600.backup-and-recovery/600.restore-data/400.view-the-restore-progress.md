# View the physical restore progress

During data restore, you can check the physical restore progress in views.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

2. Execute the following statement to view the restore progress:

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_RESTORE_PROGRESS\G
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell

   This view records the parameters you entered during restore, and other information such as the restore progress.

   During the restore process, two records are generated for each restore job: one for the `sys` tenant and one for the restored tenant. The job record for the `sys` tenant captures the restore-related information for the restored tenant, while the job record for the restored tenant focuses on tracking its own restore progress.

   Pay attention to the `status` column in the restore progress view. Here is a breakdown of the `status` values for the `sys` tenant and restored tenant:

   * For the `sys` tenant:

      * `CREATE_TENANT`: The `sys` tenant is creating the tenant to be restored. After the tenant is created, the status changes to `WAIT_TENANT_RESTORE_FINISH`. If the creation failed, the status changes to `RESTORE_FAIL`.

      * `WAIT_TENANT_RESTORE_FINISH`: The system is waiting for the restore of the tenant to complete. After the tenant is restored, the status changes to `RESTORE_SUCCESS`. If the restore fails, the status changes to `RESTORE_FAIL`.

      * `RESTORE_SUCCESS`: The tenant is restored.

      * `RESTORE_FAIL`: The restore of the tenant failed.

   * For the target tenant:

      * `RESTORING`: Data of the tenant is being restored. After the tenant is restored, the status changes to `POST_CHECK`. If the restore fails, the status changes to `RESTORE_FAIL`.

      * `POST_CHECK`: The system is checking the role of the tenant and restoring the tenant as a standby database. After the operation is completed, the status changes to `UPGRADE`. If the operation failed, the status changes to `RESTORE_FAIL`.

      * `UPGRADE`: The tenant is being upgraded. For restore across versions, an upgrade is performed for the tenant. After the operation is completed, the status changes to `RESTORE_SUCCESS`. If the operation failed, the status changes to `RESTORE_FAIL`.

      * `RESTORE_SUCCESS`: The restore succeeded.

      * `RESTORE_FAIL`: The restore failed.

   For more information about the `CDB_OB_RESTORE_PROGRESS` view, see [Views related to physical restore](../600.restore-data/900.views-of-the-restore.md).

   After the restore is completed, you can view the restore result. For more information, see [Query the restore result](../600.restore-data/500.view-the-restore-history.md).
