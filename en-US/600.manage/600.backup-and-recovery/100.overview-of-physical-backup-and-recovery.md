# Introduction to physical backup and restore

The backup and restore module is a core component of OceanBase Database, designed to ensure high availability and protect data security. It effectively prevents misoperations and safeguards against damages to the storage media. In the event of data loss caused by misoperations or storage media damage, you can rely on the backup and restore module to recover and restore the lost data.

## Overview

The current version of OceanBase Database supports Network File System (NFS), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), Tencent Cloud Object Storage (COS), and Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) as the backup media. It provides the backup, restore, and cleanup features.

OceanBase Database supports tenant-level physical backup. Physical backup data includes backup data and archive log data. Therefore, physical backup consists of log archiving and data backup. The tenants mentioned in this topic are user tenants. Physical backup is not supported for `sys` tenants or meta tenants.

Data backup refers to the backup of data, and includes full backup and incremental backup:

* Full backup refers to the backup of all macroblocks.

* Incremental backup refers to the backup of macroblocks that are added or modified since the last backup.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>To perform physical backup, you must first enable log archiving. </p>
</main>

Data backup covers the following data:

* Tenant information, including the tenant name, cluster name, time zone, locality, and tenant mode (MySQL or Oracle)

* All user table data

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Data backup backs up system variables, but does not back up tenant parameters or private system table data. </p>
</main>

Log archiving refers to the automatic backup of log data. OBServer nodes regularly archive log data to the specified backup path without manual triggering.  

OceanBase Database supports tenant-level and table-level restore. Tenant-level restore is the process of rebuilding a new tenant based on existing backup data. The tenant-level restore process includes the restore and recovery of tenant system tables and user tables. Restore returns the required baseline data to the OBServer node of the destination tenant. Recovery returns the logs corresponding to the baseline data to the OBServer node.

Table-level restore is the process of restoring a specified table from backup data to an existing tenant, which can be the source tenant, another tenant in the same cluster, or a tenant in a different cluster.

## Directory structure

### Data backup directories

The directories created by the backup feature in the backup destination and types of files in the directories are as follows:

```javascript
data_backup_dest

Top-level data backup directories contain the following types of data:

* `format.obbak`: This directory is used for recording the metadata of the backup path.

* `check_file`: This directory is used for checking the connectivity to the root backup directory.

* `backup_sets`: The summary directory that contains all data backup sets.

* `backup_set_1_full`: This directory represents a data backup set, where a directory whose name ends with `full` is a full backup set, and a directory whose name ends with `inc` is an incremental backup set. Each data backup generates a corresponding backup set, and the backup set will not be modified after the data backup is completed.

   A data backup set mainly includes the following data:

   * `backup_set_1_full_20230111T193330_20230111T193420.obbak`: This file records the ID, start time, and end time of the current backup set. This file is used only for display purposes.

   * `single_backup_set_info.obbak`: This file records the metadata of the current backup set, including the backup timestamp, dependent logs, and other information.

   * `tenant_backup_set_infos.obbak`: This file records the metadata of all existing backup sets for the current tenant.

   * `infos`: This directory records the metadata of the data backup set.

   * `logstream_1`: This directory records all the data of log stream 1, which is the system log stream of an OceanBase tenant.

   * `logstream_1001`: This directory records all the data of log stream 1001, where log streams with numbers greater than 1000 are user log streams of an OceanBase tenant.

   In addition, each log stream backup has four types of directories. Directories whose names contain `retry` record information about log stream-level retries, and directories whose names contain `turn` record information about tenant-level retries.

   * `meta_info_xx`: This directory records log stream metadata and tablet metadata.
   * `sys_data_xx`: This directory records the data of internal system tablets in log streams.
   * `minor_data_xx`: This directory records the minor-compacted data of regular tablets.
   * `major_data_xx`: This directory records the baseline data of regular tablets.

### Log archive directories

When you use NFS, OSS, or COS as the backup media, directories at the log archive destination and file types under each directory are as follows:

```javascript
log_archive_dest
    ├── check_file
    │   └── 1002_connect_file_20230111T193049.obbak // The connectivity check file.
    ├── format.obbak                                // The format information of the backup path.
    ├── rounds                                      // The round placeholder directory.
    │   └── round_d1002r1_start.obarc               // The round start placeholder.
    ├── pieces                                      // The piece placeholder directory.
    │   ├── piece_d1002r1p1_start_20230111T193049.obarc // The piece start placeholder, in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID_start_DATE.
    │   └── piece_d1002r1p1_end_20230111T193249.obarc   // The piece end placeholder, in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID_end_DATE.
    └── piece_d1002r1p1                             // The piece directory, named in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID.       
        ├── piece_d1002r1p1_20230111T193049_20230111T193249.obarc // The contiguous interval of a piece.
        ├── checkpoint   
        │   └── checkpoint_info.0.obarc             // The archiving progress of a piece that is being archived.
        ├── single_piece_info.obarc                 // The metadata of the piece.
        ├── tenant_archive_piece_infos.obarc        // The metadata of all frozen pieces before this piece.        
        ├── file_info.obarc                         // The list of files in all log streams.
        ├── logstream_1                             // Log stream 1.
        │   ├── file_info.obarc                    // The list of files in log stream 1.
        │   ├── log
        │   │   └── 1.obarc                         // The archive files in log stream 1.  
        │   └── schema_meta                         // The metadata of data dictionaries. This file is generated only in log stream 1.
        │       └── 1677588501408765915.obarc                           
        └── logstream_1001                          // Log stream 1001.
            ├── file_info.obarc                      // The list of files in log stream 1001.
            └── log
                └── 1.obarc                          // The archive file in log stream 1001.      
```

Top-level log archive directories contain the following types of data:

* `format.obbak`: This directory is used for recording the metadata of the archive path, including the tenant that uses the path.

* `check_file`: This directory is used for checking the connectivity to the root archive directory.

* `rounds`: The summary directory that records all rounds of log archiving.

* `pieces`: The summary directory that records all pieces of log archiving.

* `piece_d1002r1p1`: The piece directory for log archiving, which is named in the format of `piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID`. Here, `DESTID` refers to the ID corresponding to `log_archive_dest`, `ROUNDID` refers to the ID of the log archiving round, which is a monotonically increasing integer, and `PIECEID` refers to the ID of the log archiving piece, which is also a monotonically increasing integer.

   A log archiving piece directory includes the following data:

   * `piece_d1002r1p1_20230111T193049_20230111T193249.obarc`: This file displays the ID, start time, and end time of the current piece and is used only for display purposes.

   * `checkpoint`: This directory is used to record the archiving timestamps of active pieces. The ObArchiveScheduler module periodically updates the timestamp information in this directory.

   * `single_piece_info.obarc`: This file records the metadata of the current piece.

   * `tenant_archive_piece_infos.obarc`: This file records the metadata of all frozen pieces in the current tenant.

   * `file_info.obarc`: This file records the list of log streams within the piece.

   * `logstream_1`: This directory records the log files of log stream 1, which is the system log stream of an OceanBase tenant.

   * `logstream_1001`: This directory records the log files of log stream 1001, where log streams with numbers greater than 1000 are user log streams of an OceanBase tenant.

   Additionally, each log stream backup contains three types of data:

   * `file_info.obarc`: This file records the list of files in the log stream.

   * `log`: This directory contains all the archive files of the current log stream, with file names consistent with those in the source cluster.

   * `schema_meta`: This directory records the metadata of data dictionaries. It is only present in the system log stream but not in user log streams.

When you use S3 as the backup media, the structure of log archive directories is different from that in other media. An archive file consists of multiple small files and the corresponding metadata file. The specific directory structure is as follows:

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>Despite the difference in directory structure, backup files copied from S3 to other backup media across clouds can still be used for restore. For example, if you copy archived data from S3 to OSS, you can successfully restore data from the OSS path. </p>
</main>

```javascript
log_archive_dest
    ├── ......                                   
    └── piece_d1002r1p1                             // The piece directory, named in the format of piece_DESTID_ROUNDID_PIECEID.       
        ├── ......                         					// The list of files in all log streams.
        ├── logstream_1                             // Log stream 1.
        │   ├── file_info.obarc                    // The list of files in log stream 1.
        │   ├── log

        |		|       └── @APD_PART@0-32472973.obarc  // The actual data in the archive file, including the data from byte 0 to byte 32472973 in the log file.
        |		|		    └── ......  
        |		|		    └── @APD_PART@FORMAT_META.obarc // The format of the archive file.
        |		|		    └── @APD_PART@SEAL_META.obarc   // The metadata of the archive file.      
        │   └── schema_meta                         // The metadata of the data dictionary. This file is generated only in log stream 1.
        │       └── 1677588501408765915.obarc                           
        └── logstream_1001                          // Log stream 1001.
            ├── file_info.obarc                      // The list of files in log stream 1001.
            └── log
                └── 1.obarc                          // The archive file in log stream 1001.      
```

In the preceding directory structure, `1.obarc` indicates a single archive file that is identified by a prefix. The prefix and the name of the archive file are the same. An archive file contains the following three types of data:

* `@APD_PART@FORMAT_META.obarc`: When data is written to the archive file for the first time, the `format_meta` file is generated in this directory to record the format of the archive file.

* `@APD_PART@0-32472973.obarc`: The actual data in the archive file is written to the file named with this prefix, and the start offset and the end offset of each write are recorded in the file name.

* `@APD_PART@SEAL_META.obarc`: After data is written to the archive file for the last time, the `seal_meta` file is generated in this directory to record the metadata in the archive file.
