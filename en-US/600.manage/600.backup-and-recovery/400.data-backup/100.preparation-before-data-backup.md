# Preparations

Before you back up data, you must configure the backup destination and backup key.

## Backup architecture

Follower replicas are preferentially used for backup. The following figure shows the backup architecture:

![Backup architecture](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.1.0/EN_US/6.manage/6.backup-and-restore/LogArchiving.png)

## Configure the backup destination

Before you back up data, you must configure the `DATA_BACKUP_DEST` parameter. The `sys` tenant is used to manage the cluster and does not contain user data or support backup and restore. Therefore, you do not need to configure the `DATA_BACKUP_DEST` parameter for the `sys` tenant.

### Considerations

When you configure the backup destination, make sure that the backup path for each tenant is set to a separate empty directory. Different tenants cannot be configured with the same backup path.

### Procedure

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>The administrator user of a MySQL tenant is <code>root</code> and that of an Oracle tenant is <code>SYS</code>. </p>
   </main>

2. Configure the backup destination.

   OceanBase Database supports three types of media as the backup destination: Network File System (NFS), Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS), and Tencent Cloud Storage (COS).

   * Configure the backup destination for a specified tenant in the sys tenant.

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST= 'data_backup_path' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

   * Configure the backup destination for the current tenant in a user tenant.


      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST= 'data_backup_path';
      ```

   <main id="notice" type='notice'>
   <h4>Notice</h4>
   <p>After upgrading OceanBase Database from V4.0.x to V4.1.0, it is necessary to change the backup path. However, when upgrading from V4.1.x to V4.2.1, there is no need to modify the backup path. Moreover, during the upgrade process from V4.1.x to V4.2.1, you have the option to backup logs. </p>
   </main>
   <!-- 待确认：V4.2.1 or v4.2.x? -->

   Here are some examples:

   * NFS

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>When you use NFS as the backup destination, note the following points:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>The value of <code>data_backup_dest</code> cannot be a string with a question mark (?). </li>
      <li>The value of <code>data_backup_dest</code> must be set to an absolute path to ensure that the OBServer node has the write privilege on the backup destination.</li>
      <li>Ensure that all OBServer nodes are mounted to NFS of the same server and use the parameter settings recommended in this topic. For more information about the procedure of mounting NFS, see <a href="../200.deploy-nfs.md">Deploy NFS</a>. </li>
      </ul>
      </main>

      When using NFS as the backup medium, you can configure the backup destination for a specified tenant `mysql_tenant` from the sys tenant as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST= 'file:///data/nfs/backup/data' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      When using NFS as the backup medium, you can configure the backup destination for for a user tenant from the current tenant as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='file:///data/nfs/backup/data';
      ```
      
      In the examples above, `file://` specifies that NFS is used as the media for the backup destination, and the backup path is `file:///data/nfs/backup/data`.

   * OSS

      When you use OSS as the backup destination, you can set the backup destination and the `delete_mode` parameter to configure the backup file cleanup mode. The `delete_mode` parameter can be set to `delete` or `tagging`. If you do not specify `delete_mode`, the default cleanup mode `delete` takes effect. For more information about the`delete_mode` parameter, see [View data backup parameter settings](700.parameters-of-data-backup.md).

      When using OSS as the backup medium, you can configure the backup destination and the cleanup mode for a specified tenant `mysql_tenant` from the sys tenant as follows:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

      When using OSS as the backup medium, you can configure the backup destination and the cleanup mode for a user tenant from the current tenant as follows:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='oss://oceanbase-test-bucket/backup/?host=xxx.aliyun-inc.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&delete_mode=delete';
      ```
      In the examples above, `oss://` specifies that OSS is the backup destination. The storage bucket is named `oceanbase-test-bucket`. The path in the storage bucket is `/backup`. The question mark (`?`) is used to separate other parameters of the path. The `host` parameter specifies the host address of the storage bucket. The `access_id` and `access_key` parameters specify the access key of OSS. The cleanup mode is set to `delete`.

      For more information about the automatic cleanup of backup data in `delete` or `tagging` mode, see [Automatically clean up expired backup data](../500.clear-backup-data/100.cleaning-up-backed-up-data-automatically.md).

   * COS

     <main id="notice" type='notice'>
     <h4>Notice</h4>
     <p>If you use COS as the backup destination, you must disable the list cache for buckets. Otherwise, backup data consistency errors may occur. For guidance on how to disable the list cache of a bucket, contact the technical support of COS. </p>
     </main>

      Like OSS, COS also allows you to configure the cleanup mode of backup files by using the `delete_mode` parameter in the same way as with OSS.

     When using COS as the backup medium, you can configure the backup destination for a specified tenant `mysql_tenant` from the sys tenant as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='cos://oceanbase-test-appid/backup?host=cos.ap-xxxx.myqcloud.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&appid=xxx' TENANT = mysql_tenant;
      ```

     When using COS as the backup medium, you can configure the backup destination for a user tenant from the current tenant as follows:

     ```sql
     obclient> ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST='cos://oceanbase-test-appid/backup?host=cos.ap-xxxx.myqcloud.com&access_id=xxx&access_key=xxx&appid=xxx';
     ```

     In the examples above, `cos://` specifies that COS is the backup destination. The storage bucket is named `oceanbase-test-appid`. The path in the storage bucket is `/backup`. The question mark (`?`) is used to separate other parameters of the path. The `host` parameter specifies the host address of the storage bucket. The `access_id` and `access_key` parameters specify the access key of COS. The `appid` parameter, which is required, specifies the application ID of the COS account.

3. Query the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_PARAMETER` view from the sys tenant for the backup paths of all tenants in the current cluster. For more information, see [View data backup parameter settings](700.parameters-of-data-backup.md).

### Considerations

After you configure the `data_backup_dest` parameter, by default, the system creates a file named `format` in the directory to which the specified destination belongs. This file is used to verify the validity information of the backup destination and ensure the integrity of data in the destination. Therefore, observe the following considerations when you configure the `data_backup_dest` parameter:

* If the `format` file does not exist, the directory where the configured destination is located must be empty so that the `data_backup_dest` parameter can be set. If this directory is not empty, the system returns the `-9080` error to indicate that the `format` file does not exist.

* If the `format` file exists, its content must be verified so that the parameter can be set. Otherwise, the system returns the `-9081` error to indicate that the `format` file does not match. The content of the `format` file is verified to check whether the types of the cluster, tenant, and backup destination in the file match those of the current cluster, tenant, and backup destination.

* When you execute a backup job, the job fails to be initiated if the `format` file does not exist or fails the verification.

## Back up a key

Before you back up data, you must check the encryption status of the source tenant. If transparent encryption is configured for the source tenant, you must back up the key for the source tenant.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>After you back up the key, if key rotation has been triggered for the source tenant, you need to back up the key of the source tenant again before you restore the data. </p>
</main>

1. Log on to the database as an administrator of the `sys` tenant or a user tenant.

2. Back up a key.

   * You can back up the key for a specified tenant from the sys tenant:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY TENANT = tenant_name TO 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password';
      ```

   * You can also back up the key for the current user tenant:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY TO 'backup_key_path' ENCRYPTED BY 'password';
      ```

   where

   * `backup_key_path` specifies the backup path of the key. This path is user-defined and cannot be the same as the data backup path or log archiving path.

   * `password` specifies the encryption password for the backup path of the key.

   The following example shows how to back up the key of the `mysql_tenant` tenant to the `file:///data_backup_dest/key` path from the sys tenant:

   ```sql
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP KEY TENANT = mysql_tenant TO 'file:///data_backup_dest/key' ENCRYPTED BY '******';
   ```

3. Check the back path of the key in views.

   * In the sys tenant, you can query the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO` view for the backup path of the key:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO;
      ```

   * In a user tenant, you can query the `DBA_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO` view for the backup path of the key:

      :::tab
      tab MySQL mode

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO;
      ```

      :::

      For more information about the columns in the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO` and `DBA_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO` views, see [CDB_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/15100.oceanbase-cdb_ob_backup_storage_info-of-sys-tenant.md) and [DBA_OB_BACKUP_STORAGE_INFO](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/15200.oceanbase-dba_ob_backup_storage_info-of-sys-tenant.md), respectively.
