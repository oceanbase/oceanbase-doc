# Backup cleanup parameter

At present, when you set a cleanup strategy, you can specify only the `recovery_window` parameter, which is used to determine whether backup data is expired.

## recovery_window parameter

This parameter specifies the time window for restoring backup data and determines whether backup data has expired. The value of `recovery_window` must have a time unit. For example, if you set `recovery_window` to `7d`, the data within the last 7 days must be restorable and the data backed up earlier is considered expired.

All data backed up earlier than the latest backup data that meets the following condition is considered expired: `Current time - Backup point in time >= Value of recovery_window`.

For example, the setting `recovery_window='7d'` indicates that the data backed up within the last 7 days must be restorable, and the backup data beyond this restore window is considered expired.

The following example shows how to determine whether backup data has expired after you specify `recovery_window`, as shown in the following figure.

![Automatic backup cleanup](https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/observer-enterprise/V4.2.1/EN_US/600.manage/600.backup-and-recovery/BackupCleanup.png)

When automatic data cleanup is enabled, the system cleans up expired data on the basis of one full backup and multiple incremental backups, as shown in the preceding figure.

* First batch of backup data: full backup file `backup_set 1` on January 1 + incremental backup file `backup_set 2` on January 4

* Second batch of backup data: full backup file `backup_set 3` on January 7 + incremental backup file `backup_set 4` on January 11

* Third batch of backup data: full backup file `backup_set 5` on January 14

Assume that the current time is January 15, and the earliest restore point is January 8. Then, the backup data from January 8 to January 15 can be restored. Data is restored based on full backup files. Data restore performed before the full backup of data generated from January 8 to January 14 depends on the first full backup file before the restore point: `backup_set 3`. Therefore, the system retains `backup_set 3`. Backup data generated before January 7 is considered expired. To be specific, the first batch of backup data `backup_set 1` and `backup_set 2` have expired. When automatic data cleanup is enabled, the expired backup data will be cleaned.
