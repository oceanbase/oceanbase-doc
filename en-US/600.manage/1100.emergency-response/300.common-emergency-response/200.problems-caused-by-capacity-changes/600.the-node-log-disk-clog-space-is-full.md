# Node clog disk full

If the clog disk is fully occupied, the cluster may exhibit symptoms such as election without a leader, data write failure, and lack of replicas.

## Scenario

Data writes fail because the clog disk is full.

## Emergency handling procedure

To address the full clog disk space issue without compromising cluster data consistency, perform the following steps:

1. Stop write operations from tenants to prevent the clog disk from being quickly used up again.

2. Increase the clog disk usage threshold from 95% to 98%.

   ```sql
   ALTER system SET log_disk_utilization_limit_threshold  = 98 server ='[IP address]:2882';
   ```

3. Observe the cluster performance for a period of time. In most cases, data writing can be resume once the clog is synchronized. If the issue persists, contact OceanBase Technical Support.
