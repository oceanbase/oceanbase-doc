# Metrics

Metrics provide general diagnostic monitoring information for databases. They represent specific values collected during event tracking, such as the number of SQL statement executions, execution time, and I/O throughput. OceanBase Database supports more than 600 metrics, which are categorized into 14 classes to provide all the necessary information for key execution details such as network information, request queues, transactions, SQL statements, cache, storage, resource quotas, and logs. Some metrics, including QPS, TPS, QPS_RT, TPS_RT, and Active_sessions, provide real-time information and are collected every second in OceanBase Database. Metrics for other information are collected by minute.

The data source of the metrics is the `GV$SYSSTAT` view, which contains the following key fields:

* `CON_ID`: the ID of the tenant.

* `SVR_IP`: the IP address of the node.

* `CLASS`: the class of the metric.

* `STAT_ID`: the ID of the metric.

* `NAME`: the name of the metric.

* `VALUE`: the value of the metric.

* `VALUE_TYPE`: the value type of the metric.

The `CLASS` field indicates the class of a metric. The following table describes the 14 classes supported by OceanBase Database V4.x.

| Class code | Class name |
|---|---|
| 1 | Network |
| 2 | Request queue |
| 4 | Transaction |
| 8 | SQL |
| 16 | Cache |
| 32 | Storage |
| 64 | Resource |
| 128 | Log |
| 256 | CLOG |
| 512 | Election |
| 1024 | OBServer |
| 2048 | RootService |
| 3072 | Analyze Report |
| 4096 | TableAPI |

The `STAT_ID` and `NAME` fields describe the ID and name of a metric, respectively. For example, the following table displays the information about all metrics in the SQL class:

```shell
obclient> select distinct class,stat_id,name,VALUE_TYPE from gv$sysstat where class=8;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell

Some metrics, such as QPS, TPS, QPS_RT, and TPS_RT, provide real-time information and are collected by second.

The `CON_ID` and `SVR_IP` fields describe the monitored objects of a metric, so that metrics can be flexibly aggregated in different scenarios. For example, you can aggregate the QPS and TPS metrics based on the `CON_ID` field to observe the changes in the number of requests of a tenant, or the `SVR_IP` field to observe the changes in the number of requests of a node. When you perform load balancing on a cluster, you can aggregate the QPS and TPS metrics for resource units based on both the `CON_ID` and `SVR_IP` fields.

The `VALUE_TYPE` field describes the value type of the metric. Valid values include `ADD_VALUE` and `SET_VALUE`, which indicates the cumulative type and the status type, respectively. The values of cumulative metrics, such as SQL COUNT, SQL RT, and IO READ BYTES, keep increasing during event tracking in OceanBase Database. External monitoring systems regularly pull the cumulative metric values and calculate the differences to show the data change trend of these metrics. The latest values of status metrics, such as CACHE SIZE and CPU USAGE, are maintained during event tracking in OceanBase Database. External monitoring systems regularly pull and directly display the status metric values. In general, status metrics support aggregation only at the tenant level, while most cumulative metrics support aggregation both at the session and tenant levels.

Metrics of OceanBase Database are classified into 14 classes based on the components that they describe. The following sections describe the most frequently used metrics.

## Network metrics

```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------+---------+-----------------+------------+
| class | stat_id | name            | VALUE_TYPE |
+-------+---------+-----------------+------------+
|    64 |  140002 | max memory size | SET_VALUE  |
|    64 |  140003 | memory usage    | SET_VALUE  |
|    64 |  140005 | max cpus        | SET_VALUE  |

## Other metrics

In addition to the `GV$SYSSTAT` view, OceanBase Database provides many other views to describe the metrics from various aspects.

For example, the `GV$OB_PROCESSLIST` view describes the status of the current sessions of the system and the IDs of the executed SQL statements. This view also provides important information in fields such as `SID`, `SQL_ID`, `TRANS_ID`, and `TRACE_ID`. It is a useful tool for end-to-end tracing.

* The following example shows how to query the `GV$OB_PROCESSLIST` view for information about active sessions:

    ```shell
    obclient> select TENANT,SVR_IP,SVR_PORT,USER,HOST,COMMAND,STATE,INFO,SQL_ID,TRACE_ID 
    from GV$OB_PROCESSLIST 
    where STATE='ACTIVE' or null limit 10;
    ```

    The result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-------------------+---------+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | TENANT | SVR_IP     | SVR_PORT | USER      | HOST              | COMMAND | STATE  | INFO                                                                                                                                    | SQL_ID                           | TRACE_ID                          |
    +--------+------------+----------+-----------+-------------------+---------+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | sys    |xx.xx.xx.xx |     2882 | DBA_query | xx.xx.xx.xx:51588 | Query   | ACTIVE | select TENANT,SVR_IP,SVR_PORT,USER,HOST,COMMAND,STATE,INFO,SQL_ID,TRACE_ID from GV$OB_PROCESSLIST where STATE='ACTIVE' or null limit 10 | D18F6AE855AD0D7478162DD8EF48C781 | YB4206008451-0005F55893CEA363-0-0 |

    1 row in set (0.04 sec)
    ```

* The following example shows how to query the `GV$OB_PROCESSLIST` view for the number of active sessions on each OBServer node:

    ```shell
    obclient>
    select 
    tenant_id, tenant_name,  svr_ip,
    case 
        when cnt is null then 0 
        else cnt end 
    as cnt
    from (
        select DBA_OB_TENANTS.tenant_name, DBA_OB_TENANTS.tenant_id, svr_ip, cnt 
        from DBA_OB_TENANTS 
        left join (
            select count(`state`='ACTIVE' OR NULL) as cnt, tenant as tenant_name, svr_ip
            from GV$OB_PROCESSLIST
            group by tenant,svr_ip ) t1 
        on DBA_OB_TENANTS.tenant_name = t1.tenant_name 
    where DBA_OB_TENANTS.tenant_type!='META'
    ) t2;
    ```

    The result is as follows:

    ```shell
    +-----------+-----------------+-------------+------+
    | tenant_id | tenant_name     | svr_ip      | cnt  |
    +-----------+-----------------+-------------+------+
    |         1 | sys             | xx.xx.xx.xx |    0 |
    |         1 | sys             | xx.xx.xx.xx |   0  |
