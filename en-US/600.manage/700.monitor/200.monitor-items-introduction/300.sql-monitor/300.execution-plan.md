# Execution plans

SQL tuning is time-consuming. To avoid repeated SQL tuning, plans generated are stored in the plan cache and retrieved from the plan cache when the related SQL statement is executed again. On each node, a separate plan cache is allocated for each tenant to cache the SQL plans processed on this node.

Plan cache views display plan cache statistics, execution statistics, and plan information. The data displayed in these views is collected from plan caches. OceanBase Database provides the following plan cache views:

* `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_STAT`: displays the statistics of each plan cache. On each node, a separate plan cache is allocated for each tenant to cache the SQL plans processed on this node. In this view, each plan cache has a record.

* `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN`: displays the information about operators in the cached plans.

* `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT`: displays the details of each cached plan and its execution statistics.

The `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN` view displays the details of each execution plan in the following main fields:

* `TENANT_ID`: the ID of the tenant.
* `SVR_IP`: the IP address of the node.
* `PLAN_ID`: the ID of the execution plan.
* `PLAN_DEPTH`: the depth of the operator.
* `OPERATOR`: the name of the operator.
* `NAME`: the name of the table corresponding to the operator.
* `ROWS`: the estimated number of rows in the result.
* `COST`: the estimated cost.
* `PROPERTY`: the details of the operator.

    <ul><li>To query the <code>GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN</code> view, you must specify the <code>TENANT_ID</code>, <code>SVR_IP</code>, <code>SVR_PORT</code>, and <code>PLAN_ID</code> fields. Otherwise, no result is returned. </li>

The following example shows an execution plan:

```shell

The `GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT` view displays the details of each cached plan and its execution statistics in the following fields:

* `TENANT_ID`: the ID of the tenant.
* `SVR_IP`: the IP address of the node.
* `PLAN_ID`: the ID of the execution plan, which corresponds to the `PLAN_ID` field in the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view.
* `SQL_ID`: the ID of the SQL statement, which corresponds to the `SQL_ID` field in the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view.
* `TYPE`: the type of the execution plan. `1` indicates a local plan. `2` indicates a remote plan. `3` indicates a distributed plan.
* `STATEMENT`: the parameterized SQL statement.
* `QUERY_SQL`: the original SQL statement executed when the plan was loaded the first time.
* `FIRST_LOAD_TIME`: the time when the plan was loaded for the first time.

* `SLOWEST_EXE_TIME`: the timestamp when the slowest execution ended.
* `SLOWEST_EXE_USEC`: the amount of time consumed by the slowest execution.
* `SLOW_COUNT`: the number of times that the current plan was identified as a slow query. The query execution time threshold is specified by the cluster parameter `trace_log_slow_query_watermark`.
* `HIT_COUNT`: the number of hits.
* `LARGE_QUERYS`: the number of times that the current plan was identified as a large query. The query execution time threshold is specified by the cluster parameter `large_query_threshold`.
