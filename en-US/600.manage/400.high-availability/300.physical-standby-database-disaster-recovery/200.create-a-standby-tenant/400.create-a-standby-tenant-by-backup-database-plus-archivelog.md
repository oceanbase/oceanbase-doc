# Create a standby tenant by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature

This method is applicable to users who use OceanBase Database Community Edition or have deployed OceanBase Database in standalone mode on a single server. It generates a database snapshot for all data and archived logs of the primary tenant on the local server if the primary tenant is in standalone mode or on the shared storage in OceanBase Database Community Edition when the primary tenant belongs to a cluster. Then you can upload the snapshot to a medium accessible to the cluster where you want to create a standby tenant, and finally restore the standby tenant from the database snapshot.

## Step 1: Enable archivelog for the primary tenant and back up data

1. Log on as the administrator to the primary tenant or the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides.

2. Enable archivelog for the primary tenant.

   1. Specify the archiving destination.

      If the primary tenant is in standalone mode, you can use an accessible path on the server where the tenant replica and observer process reside as the archiving destination. Otherwise, you must use shared storage such as Network File System (NFS) or Alibaba Cloud Object Storage Service (OSS) as the archiving destination.

      Assuming that the archiving medium is NFS, the following sample statements set the archiving destination path to `/data/1/sh_archive/`:

      * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides to specify the archiving destination for the primary tenant:

         ```sql
         ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST = "LOCATION=file:///data/1/sh_archive" TENANT = mysql;
         ```

         Here, `mysql` is the name of the primary tenant.

      * Execute the following statement in the primary tenant to specify the archiving destination for the primary tenant:

         ```sql
         ALTER SYSTEM SET LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST = "LOCATION=file:///data/1/sh_archive";
         ```

      For more information, see [Preparations](../../../600.backup-and-recovery/300.log-archive/200.preparation-before-log-archive.md).

   2. Enable archivelog.

      <h4>Notice</h4>
      <p>To ensure archiving of all logs generated during data backup, you must enable archivelog for the tenant before you perform data backup.</p>
      </main>
   
      * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides to enable archivelog for the primary tenant:
   
        ```sql
        ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVELOG TENANT = mysql;
        ```
   
        Here, `mysql` is the name of the primary tenant.
   
      * Execute the following statement in the primary tenant to enable archivelog for the primary tenant:
   
        ```sql
        ALTER SYSTEM ARCHIVELOG;
        ```
   
      For more information, see [Enable ARCHIVELOG](../../../600.backup-and-recovery/300.log-archive/300.open-the-log-archive-mode.md).
   
   3. Verify that the archiving status is `DOING`.
   
      You can check the archiving status by querying the `DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG` view in the primary tenant or the `CDB_OB_ARCHIVELOG` view in the `sys` tenant. Sample SQL statements:
   
      * `sys` tenant
   
        ```sql
        SELECT DEST_ID, ROUND_ID, DEST_NO, STATUS, CHECKPOINT_SCN, CHECKPOINT_SCN_DISPLAY, PATH FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_ARCHIVELOG;
        ```
   
      * MySQL tenant
   
        ```sql
        SELECT DEST_ID, ROUND_ID, DEST_NO, STATUS, CHECKPOINT_SCN, CHECKPOINT_SCN_DISPLAY, PATH FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG;
        ```
   
      * Oracle tenant
   
        ```sql
        SELECT DEST_ID, ROUND_ID, DEST_NO, STATUS, CHECKPOINT_SCN, CHECKPOINT_SCN_DISPLAY, PATH FROM SYS.DBA_OB_ARCHIVELOG;
        ```
   
      The query result is as follows:
   
      ```sql
      +---------+----------+---------+--------+---------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------+
      | DEST_ID | ROUND_ID | DEST_NO | STATUS | CHECKPOINT_SCN      | CHECKPOINT_SCN_DISPLAY     | PATH                           |
      +---------+----------+---------+--------+---------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------+
      |    1001 |        1 |       0 | DOING  | 1680867152120380679 | 2023-04-07 19:32:32.120380 | file:///data/1/xianlin_archive |
      +---------+----------+---------+--------+---------------------+----------------------------+--------------------------------+
      1 row in set
      ```
   
      In the query result, the value of `STATUS` is `DOING`, which indicates that the system is archiving logs.
   
      For more information, see [View the archiving progress](../../../600.backup-and-recovery/300.log-archive/600.view-log-archive-progress.md).

3. Perform a data backup for the primary tenant by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature.

   After you enable archivelog, you must perform a data backup for the primary tenant by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature to generate a database snapshot.

   1. Specify the backup destination.

      If the primary tenant is in standalone mode, you can use an accessible path on the server where the tenant replica and observer process reside as the backup destination. The backup destination path must be different from the archiving destination path. Otherwise, you must use shared storage such as NFS or Alibaba Cloud OSS as the backup destination.

      Assuming that the backup medium is NFS, the following sample statements set the backup destination path to `/data/1/sh_databackup`:

      * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides to specify the backup destination for the primary tenant:

         ```sql
         ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'file:///data/1/sh_databackup' TENANT = mysql;
         ```

         Here, `mysql` is the name of the primary tenant.

      * Execute the following statement in the primary tenant to specify the backup destination for the primary tenant:

         ```sql
         ALTER SYSTEM SET DATA_BACKUP_DEST = 'file:///data/1/sh_databackup';
         ```

      For more information, see [Preparations](../../../600.backup-and-recovery/400.data-backup/100.preparation-before-data-backup.md).

   2. Perform a data backup.

      * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides to perform the data backup:

        ```sql
        ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP TENANT = mysql PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
        ```

         Here, `mysql` is the name of the primary tenant.

      * Execute the following statement in the primary tenant to perform the data backup:

         ```sql
         ALTER SYSTEM BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
         ```

   3. Check the data backup status.

      You can check the data backup progress by querying the `DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOBS` view in the primary tenant or the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_JOBS` view in the `sys` tenant. Sample SQL statements:

      * `sys` tenant

         ```sql
         SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_JOBS;
         ```

      * MySQL tenant

         ```sql
         SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOBS;
         ```

      * Oracle tenant

         ```sql
         SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOBS;
         ```

      If the backup has started, the progress of the backup job is displayed in the views. For more information, see [View the data backup progress](../../../600.backup-and-recovery/400.data-backup/500.view-data-backup-progress.md).

      If the backup is completed, you can view the data backup history by querying the `DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOB_HISTORY` view in a user tenant or the `CDB_OB_BACKUP_JOB_HISTORY` view in the `sys` tenant. Sample SQL statements:

      * `sys` tenant

         ```sql
         SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BACKUP_JOB_HISTORY;
         ```

      * MySQL tenant

         ```sql
         SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOB_HISTORY;
         ```

      * Oracle tenant

         ```sql
         SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BACKUP_JOB_HISTORY;
         ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +--------+-------------+---------------+---------------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------------------+
      | JOB_ID | INCARNATION | BACKUP_SET_ID | INITIATOR_TENANT_ID | INITIATOR_JOB_ID | EXECUTOR_TENANT_ID | PLUS_ARCHIVELOG | BACKUP_TYPE | JOB_LEVEL   | ENCRYPTION_MODE | PASSWD | START_TIMESTAMP            | END_TIMESTAMP              | STATUS    | RESULT | COMMENT | DESCRIPTION | PATH                          |
      +--------+-------------+---------------+---------------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------------------+
      |      1 |           1 |             1 |                1004 |                0 | 1004               | ON              | FULL        | USER_TENANT | NONE            |        | 2023-04-07 19:52:35.361398 | 2023-04-07 19:58:57.223196 | COMPLETED |      0 |         |             | file:///data/1/sh_databackup |
      +--------+-------------+---------------+---------------------+------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-------------+-------------+-----------------+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------+-----------+--------+---------+-------------+-------------------------------+
      1 row in set
      ```

      In the query result, the value of `STATUS` is `COMPLETED`, which indicates that the data backup is completed. The value of the `PLUS_ARCHIVELOG` field is `ON`, which indicates that the data backup is performed by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature. In this case, the backup directory contains the archived logs required for the operation of the database. The data backup and archived logs constitute a database snapshot.

## Step 2: Disable archivelog for the primary tenant

After the data backup, you do not need to continuously archive logs. You can disable archivelog for the primary tenant.

1. Log on as the administrator to the primary tenant or the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides.

2. Disable archivelog for the primary tenant.

   * Execute the following statement in the `sys` tenant of the cluster where the primary tenant resides to disable archivelog for the primary tenant:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM NOARCHIVELOG TENANT = mysql;
      ```

      Here, `mysql` is the name of the primary tenant.

   * Execute the following statement in the primary tenant to disable archivelog for the primary tenant:

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM NOARCHIVELOG;
      ```

## Step 3: Obtain the data backup and store it at a location accessible to the standby tenant

1. Obtain the data backup for the primary tenant from the specified backup destination.

   For example, the data backup is stored at `/data/1/sh_databackup`.

2. Store the data backup at a location accessible to the standby tenant to be created.

   For example, if the primary tenant is in standalone mode, package the data backup and copy it to an accessible path on the server where the replica of the standby tenant and the observer process reside. Otherwise, you can store the data backup in shared storage such as NFS or Alibaba Cloud OSS that is accessible to the standby tenant.

## Step 4: Restore the standby tenant by using the database snapshot

1. Log on as the `root` user to the `sys` tenant of the cluster where you want to create the standby tenant.

2. Create a unit with required specifications for the standby tenant.

   The following sample statement creates a unit named `unit1` that contains 1 CPU core and 5 GB of memory.

   ```sql
   CREATE RESOURCE UNIT unit1 MAX_CPU 1, MEMORY_SIZE = '5G';
   ```

   For more information, see [Create a tenant](../../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

3. Create a resource pool for the standby tenant.

   The following sample statement creates a resource pool named `pool_for_standby`.

   ```sql
   CREATE RESOURCE POOL pool_for_standby UNIT = 'unit1', UNIT_NUM = 1, ZONE_LIST = ('zone1','zone2','zone3');
   ```

   For more information, see [Create a tenant](../../../200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

4. Restore the standby tenant from the database snapshot of the primary tenant.

   Assuming that the data backup is stored at `file:///data/1/sh_databackup`, which is accessible to the standby tenant, execute the following SQL statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM RESTORE standby_tenant FROM 'file:///data/1/sh_databackup' WITH 'pool_list=pool_for_standby';
   ```

5. Verify that the restore is completed.

   You can check the restore progress by querying the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view.

   ```sql
   SELECT TENANT_NAME, TENANT_TYPE, CREATE_TIME, STATUS, TENANT_ROLE,SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP(SYNC_SCN)  FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'standby_tenant';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----------------+-------------+----------------------------+--------+-------------+----------------------------+
   | TENANT_NAME    | TENANT_TYPE | CREATE_TIME                | STATUS | TENANT_ROLE | SCN_TO_TIMESTAMP(SYNC_SCN) |
   +----------------+-------------+----------------------------+--------+-------------+----------------------------+
   | standby_tenant | USER        | 2023-04-07 20:43:39.883628 | NORMAL | STANDBY     | 2023-04-07 20:05:16.617492 |
   +----------------+-------------+----------------------------+--------+-------------+----------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   In the query result, the value of `TENANT_ROLE` is `STANDBY`, which indicates that the standby tenant is restored.

## What to do next

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>Unlike a standby tenant created by using the physical backup and recovery feature, a standby tenant restored by using the BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG feature does not have a log restore source. You must specify a log restore source to enable continuous log synchronization for the restored standby tenant. </p>
</main>

After you create a standby tenant by using this method, you must perform the following operations:

1. [Specify a log restore source](../300.log-transport-service/200.configure-the-log-transport-service/100.set-log-restore-source.md)

2. [Specify a log restore end point](../300.log-transport-service/200.configure-the-log-transport-service/200.set-log-restore-endpoint.md)
