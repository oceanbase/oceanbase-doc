# Limitations

This topic introduces the limitations on the physical standby database solution.

| Limitation | Description |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum number of standby tenants supported by one primary tenant | Unlimited |
| Requirement for the primary and standby tenants to have homogeneous resources | Not required. It is recommended for the primary and standby tenants to use the same resource specifications.  |
| Parameters | Parameters of the primary and standby tenants are independent and not physically synchronized. If a parameter of the primary tenant is modified, it needs to be evaluated whether the same parameter of the standby tenant needs to modified as well.  |
| System variables | System variables of the primary and standby tenants are physically synchronized. If a system variable of the primary tenant is modified, the system will synchronize the same system variable on the standby tenants.  |
| Users and user passwords | Creating users and changing user passwords are only supported on the primary tenant. The updated information will be synchronized to the standby tenants.  |
| Read/write operations | Read operations are supported on the standby tenants, while write operations are not supported.  |
| Minor and major compactions | Minor compactions of the primary and standby tenants are independent. </br>Major compactions are not performed on the standby tenants. Instead, the major compaction information is synchronized from the primary tenant to the standby tenants.  |
| Switchover | All replicas of the log streams on the standby tenants must be online. |
| Failover | All replicas of the log streams on the standby tenants must be online. |
