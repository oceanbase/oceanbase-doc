# Delete a resource management plan

You can call the `DELETE_PLAN` subprogram in the `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER` package to delete an idle resource management plan.

## Prerequisites

The resource management plan to be deleted exists.

## Considerations

After a resource management plan is deleted, the plan directive associated with the resource management plan is also deleted.

## Procedure

1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of the cluster as the administrator of the tenant.

2. Call the `DELETE_PLAN` subprogram in the `DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER` package to delete a resource management plan.

   ```sql
   obclient [test]> CALL DBMS_RESOURCE_MANAGER.DELETE_PLAN(
   PLAN => 'daytime'
   );
   ```

   Here, `PLAN` specifies the resource management plan.

3. Query the `oceanbase.DBA_RSRC_PLANS` view to verify whether the resource management plan is deleted.

   ```sql
   +---------+------+----------+-----------------------------------+
   | PLAN_ID | PLAN | SUB_PLAN | COMMENTS                          |
   +---------+------+----------+-----------------------------------+
   |    NULL | DAY  | NULL     | This resource management plan is intended for transaction processing.             |
   +---------+------+----------+-----------------------------------+
   1 row in set
   ```
