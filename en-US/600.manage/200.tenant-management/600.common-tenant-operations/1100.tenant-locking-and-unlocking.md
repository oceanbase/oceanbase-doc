# Lock and unlock a tenant

OceanBase Database supports locking tenants. When a tenant is locked, new connections cannot be created on that tenant, but existing connections remain unchanged. This topic describes how to lock and unlock a tenant.

## Background information

Tenants can be locked and unlocked using the `ALTER TENANT` statement. It is applicable in emergency handling scenarios and operational change scenarios.

* Emergency handling scenarios: If a tenant is experiencing issues and being recovered, you can lock the tenant to prevent business traffic from affecting the recovery process, with the consent of the customer. After locking the tenant, you must kill the corresponding sessions.

* Operational change scenarios: For example, if a tenant needs to be taken offline, the offline process must follow principles such as gray-scale release and rollback. Locking the tenant can be one of the steps to observe the impact on the business system.

## Lock a tenant

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   ```shell
   obclient -h172.30.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#cluster -p**** -A
   ```

2. Access the database named `oceanbase`.

   ```sql
   USE oceanbase;
   ```

3. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view for information about a tenant.

   To query the locking status of the `mq_t1` tenant, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID,TENANT_NAME,LOCKED FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'mq_t1';
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   |      1036 | mq_t1       | NO     |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   For more information about the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/23100.o-dba_ob_tenants-of-sys-tenant.md).

4. Execute the `ALTER TENANT` statement to lock the tenant.

   To lock the `mq_t1` tenant, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER TENANT mq_t1 LOCK;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   For more information about the `ALTER TENANT` statement, see [ALTER TENANT](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/100.system-tenants/500.alter-tenant.md).

5. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view to verify whether the tenant is successfully locked.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID,TENANT_NAME,LOCKED FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'mq_t1';
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   |      1036 | mq_t1       | YES    |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

## Unlock a tenant

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   ```shell
   obclient -h172.30.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#cluster -p**** -A
   ```

2. Access the database named `oceanbase`.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> USE oceanbase;
   ```

3. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view for information about a tenant.

   To query the locking status of the `mq_t1` tenant, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID,TENANT_NAME,LOCKED FROM DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'mq_t1';
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   |      1036 | mq_t1       | YES    |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   For more information about the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/23100.o-dba_ob_tenants-of-sys-tenant.md).

4. Execute the `ALTER TENANT` statement to unlock the tenant.

   To unlock the `mq_t1` tenant, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER TENANT mq_t1 UNLOCK;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   For more information about the `ALTER TENANT` statement, see [ALTER TENANT](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/100.system-tenants/500.alter-tenant.md).

5. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view to verify whether the tenant is successfully locked.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID,TENANT_NAME,LOCKED FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'mq_t1';
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   | TENANT_ID | TENANT_NAME | LOCKED |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   |      1036 | mq_t1       | NO     |
   +-----------+-------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```
