# Internal wait events

If you confirm that the performance bottleneck is not caused by execution plans or resource capacity issues during the execution, it is likely caused by internal wait events. In an internal wait event, the worker threads wait for the required resources, such as:

* Locks

* Latches

* I/O

* Memory

You can query the `V$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view. If you can find SQL queries that result in a large value of the `EXECUTE_TIME` field, and the execution duration is prolonged mainly due to the increase of the value of `TOTAL_WAIT_TIME_MICRO`, the performance bottleneck is caused by internal wait events. The value of `TOTAL_WAIT_TIME_MICRO` is the sum of the values of several parameters, such as `APPLICATION_WAIT_TIME`, `CONCURRENCY_WAIT_TIME`, `USER_IO_WAIT_TIME`, and `SCHEDULE_TIME`. You can perform further analysis to determine the types of resources that the worker threads are waiting for.
