# Cardinality

Cardinality means that an execution plan generated by the optimizer is optimal for a particular dataset and is stored in the plan cache. However, this plan may not be optimal for subsequent datasets. As a result, the execution duration of a subsequent SQL query increases and the throughput decreases.

This issue may arise in the following scenario:

A table stores order information and each record has two columns: user ID and order ID. Indexes are created on the user ID and order ID columns, respectively.

You can use the following methods to solve this issue:

* Refresh the plan cache. This operation clears cached execution plans and triggers hard parsing to generate new ones. However, suboptimal execution plans may still be generated.

* Bind a specific execution plan: You can bind a specific plan to the target SQL query by executing the `CREATE OUTLINE` statement.
