# Locate and analyze slow queries II

In a transaction processing (TP) business scenario, SQL queries are often short, taking only milliseconds to execute, yet they are executed at an extremely high frequency. Determining whether a short query is slow based on its execution time is not straightforward. When identifying a slow short query, the crucial factor is to calculate the number of rows read in a query, rather than simply observing its absolute execution time.

## Sample scenario

In the following query, if the `IDX_C1` index is used, each execution needs to read a very small number of rows, and therefore takes only hundreds of microseconds or several milliseconds. However, if the query scans the whole table, each execution needs to read a large amount of data, and therefore takes tens of milliseconds to hundreds of milliseconds.

Simply from the perspective of execution time, the query is not slow. However, if the query is executed at a quite high frequency, it still consumes a lot of computing resources and may even use up the CPU resources.

```sql
CREATE TABLE T1 (C1 INT, C2 INT);
CREATE INDEX IDX_C1 ON T1 (C1);

// Insert 10,000 rows into T1 and C1 is almost unique.

SELECT * FROM T1 WHERE C1 = 1;
```

## Locate a slow short query

To locate a slow short query, you need to collect aggregate statistics to calculate the overall resource consumption of a certain type of queries. In OceanBase Database, you can use the `gv$sql_audit` view for location. A typical diagnostic process for locating a slow short query is as follows:

The following statement obtains the top 10 queries of a certain type that read the most number of rows. If the numbers of rows read by the top queries are significantly higher by one to two orders of magnitude, their optimization will bring a great performance improvement. That is, it is very worthwhile to optimize the execution plans of the queries.

In the actual diagnostic process, the number of rows read is not the only metric that causes high CPU utilization. You can also try to sort and analyze queries by other metrics, such as the total CPU time, the number of retries (`retry_cnt`), and the number of RPCs (`rpc_count`). You can finally locate possible slow queries based on multi-dimension analysis.

```
select /*+READ_CONSISTENCY(WEAK), QUERY_TIMEOUT(100000000)*/  svr_ip, sql_id,
    tenant_id, tenant_name, user_name, db_name, plan_id,

    round(avg(execute_time)) execute_time,

    sum(memstore_read_row_count + ssstore_read_row_count) as total_row_count
    from   gv$ob_sql_audit
    where  is_inner_sql = 0
    group  by svr_ip, sql_id order by total_row_count desc limit 10;
```

## Obtain the execution plan of a slow short query

You can obtain information about the execution plan for a preceding slow short SQL query based on the query information returned.

1. Execute the following statement to obtain information about the execution plan of a slow short SQL query.

   Use the actual tenant ID for `tenant_id` and specify `svr_ip` and `sql_id` based on the previously returned information about the slow short SQL query.

    ```
    SELECT tenant_id,
       svr_ip,
       svr_port,
       sql_id,
       plan_id,
       last_active_time,
       first_load_time,
       outline_data
    FROM GV$OB_PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_STAT
    WHERE TENANT_ID = 1002
    AND SQL_ID = '3310A1D1D81D4BA92CEEF42538136DD1'
    AND SVR_IP = '11.xxx.x.xx'
    AND SVR_PORT = 35046;
    ```

   The following result is returned, which displays information about the execution plan for the query, including the plan ID (`plan_id`), time when the plan was first generated (`first_load_time`), and time when the plan was last used (`last_active_time`). For batch processing, `last_active_time` is very likely the time when the slow query was initiated.

   Here, `outline_data` is the hint description of the execution plan.

   ```sql
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
       tenant_id: 1002
           svr_ip: 11.xxx.x.xx
           svr_port: 35046
           sql_id: 3310A1D1D81D4BA92CEEF42538136DD1
           plan_id: 741
   last_active_time: 2022-08-04 11:00:34.466037
   first_load_time: 2022-08-04 11:00:34.466037
       outline_data: /*+ BEGIN_OUTLINE_DATA FULL(@"SEL$1" "test.t1"@"SEL$1") END_OUTLINE_DATA*/
   ```

2. Obtain the tree-shaped execution plan for the slow SQL query.

   Execute the following statement:

    ```sql
    SELECT OPERATOR, NAME, ROWS, COST FROM GV$PLAN_CACHE_PLAN_EXPLAIN
    WHERE TENANT_ID = 1002 AND
        SVR_IP = '11.xxx.x.xx' AND
        SVR_PORT = 35046 AND
        PLAN_ID = 741 ;
    ```

   The physical plan for the query is as follows:

   ```sql
   +----------------+------+------+------+
   | OPERATOR       | NAME | ROWS | COST |
   +----------------+------+------+------+
   | PHY_TABLE_SCAN | t1   |    1 |   45 |
   +----------------+------+------+------+
   ```

   You can also try to obtain the logical plan by using the `EXPLAIN` statement.

   ```sql
   explain select sleep(1000), rand() from t1;

   *************************** 1. row ***************************
   Query Plan: ===================================
   |ID|OPERATOR  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
   -----------------------------------
   |0 |TABLE SCAN|t1  |1        |46  |
   ===================================

   Outputs & filters:
   -------------------------------------
   0 - output([sleep(?)], [rand()]), filter(nil),
       access([t1.__pk_increment]), partitions(p0)
   ```
