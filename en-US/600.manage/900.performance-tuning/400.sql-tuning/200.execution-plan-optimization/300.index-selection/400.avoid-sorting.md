# Avoid sorting

Generally, the results of an index scan are sorted by indexed columns. For example, given an index `IDX(C1, C2, C3)`, scanning this index will yield results that are ordered by `C1, C2, C3`. This ordered nature can be used to optimize queries that include an `ORDER BY` clause. This topic describes how to construct an index for optimization by taking the following query as an example.

```sql
CREATE TABLE T1 (C1 INT, C2 INT, C3 INT, C4 INT);

SELECT * FROM T1 WHERE C1 = 1 ORDER BY C3 LIMIT 5;
```

For the query, you can create the `IDX_C1` index on the `C1` column based on the filter predicate.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IDX_C1 ON T1(C1);

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM T1 WHERE C1 = 1 ORDER BY C3 LIMIT 5;
| ===========================================
|ID|OPERATOR    |NAME      |EST. ROWS|COST|
-------------------------------------------
|0 |LIMIT       |          |5        |6527|
|1 | TOP-N SORT |          |5        |6527|
|2 |  TABLE SCAN|t1(IDX_C1)|990      |5832|
===========================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.C1], [t1.C2], [t1.C3], [t1.C4]), filter(nil), limit(5), offset(nil)
  1 - output([t1.C1], [t1.C2], [t1.C3], [t1.C4]), filter(nil), sort_keys([t1.C3, ASC]), topn(5)
  2 - output([t1.C1], [t1.C2], [t1.C3], [t1.C4]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.C1], [t1.C2], [t1.C3], [t1.C4]), partitions(p0)
```

By using the `IDX_C1` index, the database scans all rows that meet the `C1 = 1` condition. Then, the database performs heap sort by `C3` and retains the five rows with the smallest `C3` values. If there are many rows that meet the `C1 = 1` condition, scan and heap sort will take more time. In this case, you can take further advantage of the sorted index scan result. You can create the `IDX_C1_C3` index on the `C1, C3` columns.

```sql
CREATE INDEX IDX_C1_C3 ON T1(C1, C3);

EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM T1 WHERE C1 = 1 ORDER BY C3 LIMIT 5;
| ============================================
|ID|OPERATOR  |NAME         |EST. ROWS|COST|
--------------------------------------------
|0 |TABLE SCAN|t1(IDX_C1_C3)|5        |111 |
============================================

Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([t1.C1], [t1.C2], [t1.C3], [t1.C4]), filter(nil),
      access([t1.C1], [t1.C2], [t1.C3], [t1.C4]), partitions(p0),
      limit(5), offset(nil)
```

This index has two benefits:

* The `C1 = 1` predicate can be used to determine the query range on the index.
* The scan result is sorted by `C1, C3`. Since the values of `C1` are fixed, the result is also sorted by `C3`. The execution engine only needs to scan the first five rows to obtain the final query result. The sort operation is thereby eliminated.

For an index on `(C1, C2, C3, C4)`, if a query has equality predicates on `C1, C2`, the scan result is sorted by `C3, C4`. However, if the query has a non-equality predicate on the `C2` column, the scan result is sorted by `C2, C3, C4`.

For the following query, the optimization can be performed in two ways:

* Use an index on `C1, C2` to narrow down the query range with more predicates.
* Use an index on `C1, C3` to avoid sorting based on the sorted scan result.

To determine which optimization method is better, you need to consider the selectivity of the predicates `C1 = 1` and `C2 > 1`.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM T1 WHERE C1 = 1 AND C2 > 1 ORDER BY C3 LIMIT 5;
```

The rules are as follows:

1. If neither of `C1 = 1` and `C2 > 1` is selective enough, the index on `C1, C3` will be better.
2. If `C1 = 1` is not selective enough but `C2 > 1` is highly selective, the index on `C1, C2` will be better.
3. If `C1 = 1` is highly selective, the performance of the two indexes may be close. The performance of the index on `C1, C2` is more stable. The performance of the index on `C1, C3` depends on the actual data distribution, and may be extremely good in some scenarios but poor in others.
