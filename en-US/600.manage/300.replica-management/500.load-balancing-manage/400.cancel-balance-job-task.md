# Cancel a load balancing job

Each tenant can only have one balance job running at a time. If the current balance job does not meet business needs, you can cancel the task. Alternatively, if you have initiated a partition transfer but find that an ongoing balance job is delaying the scheduling of the partition transfer task, you can first cancel the current balance job.

## Limitations

You can cancel load balancing jobs only in primary databases or tenants.

## Background information

Each tenant can only have one balance job running at a time. These jobs include scaling up, scaling down, migration balancing, and partition balancing. Each balance job generates multiple balancing tasks to perform specific load balancing operations. Canceling a balance job will cancel all running tasks under that job.

## Cancel a load balancing job in the `sys` tenant

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Query the `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view for the status of the current job.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1002;
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------+--------+---------+
   | TENANT_ID | JOB_ID | CREATE_TIME                | MODIFY_TIME                | BALANCE_STRATEGY     | JOB_TYPE   | TARGET_UNIT_NUM | TARGET_PRIMARY_ZONE_NUM | STATUS | COMMENT |
   +-----------+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------+--------+---------+
   |      1002 | 520683 | 2023-11-01 14:56:28.552867 | 2023-11-01 14:56:28.552867 | LS balance by shrink | LS_BALANCE |               1 |                       1 | DOING  | NULL    |
   +-----------+--------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------------------+------------+-----------------+-------------------------+--------+---------+
   1 row in set
   ```

3. If the query result shows that the job does not meet your expectation, execute the following statement to cancel it:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BALANCE JOB TENANT = 'tenant_name';
   ```

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BALANCE JOB TENANT ='mysql_tenant';
   ```

## Cancel a load balancing job in a user tenant

1. Connect to the database as the tenant administrator of a MySQL or Oracle tenant.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@mysql_tenant#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Query the `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view for the status of the current job.

   :::tab
   tab MySQL mode

   The query statement in MySQL mode is as follows:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS;
   ```

   tab Oracle mode

   The query statement in Oracle mode is as follows:

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS;
   ```

   :::

3. If the query result shows that the job does not meet your expectation, execute the following statement to cancel it:

   ```shell
   obclient> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL BALANCE JOB;
   ```
