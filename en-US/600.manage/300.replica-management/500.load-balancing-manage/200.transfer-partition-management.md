# Transfer a partition

When automatic load balancing cannot meet your aggregation and dispersion requirements for a specific partition, you can manually transfer a partition.

## Limitations and considerations

* You must have the `ALTER SYSTEM` permission to transfer a partition. For more information about permissions, see [Users and permissions](../../500.security-and-permissions/300.access-control/200.user-and-permission/100.user-and-permission-overview.md).

* You can perform the TRANSFER PARTITION operation only in the primary tenant to transfer only a partition of a user tenant.

* After you set the `enable_transfer` parameter to `false` to disable the transfer feature for a tenant, an error will be returned if you execute the `TRANSFER PARTITION` statement for this tenant, and a partition transfer task initiated by a successfully executed `TRANSFER PARTITION` statement may be canceled.

* You cannot perform partition transfer for a system table.

* You cannot perform partition transfer for a user table in the sys tenant.

* You cannot transfer a normal table to a broadcast log stream or transfer a replicated table to a normal log stream.

* You cannot transfer a non-independent partition, such as a partition of a local index table or large object (LOB) table.

* If a transfer operation is in progress for a partition, you cannot initiate another transfer operation for this partition before the current transfer operation is completed.

* If a load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) is in progress in the current cluster, a manually initiated partition transfer task will not be immediately scheduled. If you want to schedule the partition transfer task as soon as possible, you can cancel the load balancing job. For more information, see [Cancel a load balancing job](400.cancel-balance-job-task.md).

## Prerequisites

* Before transferring a partition, you must enable the transfer feature. You can set the `enable_transfer` parameter to enable or disable the transfer feature. The default value of the parameter is `true`, indicating that the transfer feature is enabled. For more information about the `enable_transfer` parameter, see [enable_transfer](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/3000.enable_transfer.md).

* The partition transfer policy may conflict with the automatic balancing policy. To ensure a fixed partition location, we recommend that you disable the automatic balancing policy before you perform a partition transfer, that is, set `enable_rebalance` to `false` for the corresponding tenant. For more information about the `enable_rebalance` parameter, see [enable_rebalance](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/2800.enable_rebalance.md).

   Partition transfer itself is not subject to the `enable_rebalance` parameter. However, if both `enable_rebalance` and `enable_transfer` are set to `true`, after a user transfers a partition to the corresponding log stream, the system may transfer the partition to another log stream based on the automatic balancing policy.

## Initiate a partition transfer from the sys tenant

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view for the ID of the target tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS WHERE TENANT_NAME = 'oracle_tenant';
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+
   | TENANT_ID |
   +-----------+
   |      1006 |
   +-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

3. Confirm the partition information.

   You can query the `CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS` view for `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of the specified partition.

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a non-partitioned table

      Assume that non-partitioned table `T1` exists in the `oracle_tenant` tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T1' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500002 |    500002 |    200001 |  1001 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a partitioned table

      You need to specify only the partition name for the query.

      Assume that partitioned table `TBL1_LOG_R` exists in the `oracle_tenant` tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE tbl1_log_r(log_id INT,log_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATE)
       PARTITION BY RANGE(log_date)
        (PARTITION M202001 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/02/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202002 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/03/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202003 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/04/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202004 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/05/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202005 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/06/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202006 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/07/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202007 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/08/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202008 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/09/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202009 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/10/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202010 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/11/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202011 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/12/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202012 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2021/01/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION MMAX VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
         );
      ```

      The following sample code queries related information about the `M202005` partition in the partitioned table.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'TBL1_LOG_R' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'M202005' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500003 |    500009 |    200006 |  1002 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a subpartitioned table

      You need to specify both the partition and subpartition names for the query.

      Assume that subpartitioned table `T2_F_RL` exists in the `oracle_tenant` tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE t2_f_rl(col1 INT,col2 VARCHAR2(50))
       PARTITION BY RANGE(col1)
       SUBPARTITION BY LIST(col2)
       (PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN(100)
         (SUBPARTITION sp0 VALUES('01'),
          SUBPARTITION sp1 VALUES('02')
          ),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN(200)
         (SUBPARTITION sp2 VALUES('01'),
          SUBPARTITION sp3 VALUES('02'),
          SUBPARTITION sp4 VALUES('03')
         )
        );
      ```

      The following sample code queries related information about the `SP2` subpartition in the subpartitioned table.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T2_F_RL' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'P1' AND SUBPARTITION_NAME = 'SP2' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500018 |    500023 |    200017 |  1003 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

4. Select the transfer destination.

   1. Query the `CDB_OB_LS` view for the log stream status and information of the tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_LS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      | TENANT_ID | LS_ID | STATUS | PRIMARY_ZONE | UNIT_GROUP_ID | LS_GROUP_ID | CREATE_SCN          | DROP_SCN | SYNC_SCN            | READABLE_SCN        | FLAG |
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      |      1006 |     1 | NORMAL | zone1        |             0 |           0 |                NULL |     NULL | 1701244663685197789 | 1701244663685197789 |      |
      |      1006 |  1001 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1006 |        1001 | 1701239786827662637 |     NULL | 1701244663685197789 | 1701244663685197789 |      |
      |      1006 |  1002 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1007 |        1002 | 1701239786831568305 |     NULL | 1701244664066906860 | 1701244664066906859 |      |
      |      1006 |  1003 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1008 |        1003 | 1701239786834300282 |     NULL | 1701244664175263949 | 1701244664175263948 |      |
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

   2. Query the `CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view for the distribution of tablets on the log streams.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT LS_ID, COUNT(*) AS C FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLET_TO_LS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 GROUP BY LS_ID;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-------+------+
      | LS_ID | C    |
      +-------+------+
      |     1 |  578 |
      |  1001 |    7 |
      |  1002 |    5 |
      |  1003 |    7 |
      +-------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

      Select an appropriate log stream as the transfer destination based on the preceding information.

5. Execute the following statement to perform partition transfer:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] table_id, OBJECT_ID [=] object_id TO LS ls_id TENANT = 'tenant_name';
   ```

   where:

   * `table_id` indicates the ID of the table.

   * `object_id` indicates the unique ID of the partition.

   * `ls_id` indicates the ID of the log stream to which the partition is to be transferred.

   * `tenant_name` indicates the tenant to which the partition to be transferred belongs.

   The following sample code transfers the `M202005` partition of the `TBL1_LOG_R` table in the `SYS` database from log stream `1002` to log stream `1003` in the `oracle_tenant` tenant.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID = 500003, OBJECT_ID = 500009 TO LS 1003 TENANT = 'oracle_tenant';
   ```

6. After the statement is executed, query the status of the partition transfer task.

   1. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view for the `TASK_ID`, `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, and `BALANCE_JOB_ID` values of the task.

      The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view displays the ongoing partition transfer tasks of all tenants. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TASK_ID, BALANCE_JOB_ID, TRANSFER_TASK_ID, STATUS FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND TABLE_ID = 500003 AND OBJECT_ID = 500009;
      ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      | TASK_ID | BALANCE_JOB_ID | TRANSFER_TASK_ID | STATUS |
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      |       1 |          17304 |                1 | DOING  |
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      1 row in set
      ```

      The value of the `STATUS` field indicates the status of the task. Valid values:

      * `WAITING`: The task is waiting to be scheduled.
      * `INIT`: A load balancing job has been constructed for the task. You can view the execution progress of the load balancing job based on its `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.
      * `DOING`: The task is in progress. You can view the task based on `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, which will change several times. A partition transfer task involves multiple transfers.

      If the query on the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view returns an empty result set, you can query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view for the task execution result.

   2. Query the `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` or `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value to confirm the execution status of the associated load balancing job.

      The `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view displays the ongoing load balancing jobs of all tenants. Each tenant can have only one running load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) at a time. A load balancing job generates multiple transfer tasks (TRANSFER_TASK). The `CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view displays the historical load balancing jobs of all tenants. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOBS WHERE JOB_ID = 17304;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY WHERE JOB_ID = 17304;
      ```

      You must replace `17304` with the `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

      The `STATUS` column in the query result indicates the execution status of the load balancing job. Valid values:

      * `DOING`: The load balancing job is in progress.
      * `COMPLETED`: The load balancing job was successfully executed.
      * `CANCELING`: The load balancing job is being canceled.
      * `CANCELED`: The load balancing job has been canceled.

   3. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` or `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value for the execution status of the transfer task.

      The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` view displays the ongoing transfer tasks of all tenants. Multiple ongoing transfer tasks (TRANSFER_TASK) that belong to the same load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) can exist concurrently in a tenant. The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view displays the historical transfer tasks of all tenants. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
      ```

      You must replace `1` with the `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

      The `STATUS` column in the query result indicates the execution status of the transfer task. Valid values:

      * `INIT`: The task is being created.
      * `START`: The task starts to be executed.
      * `DOING`: The task is in progress.
      * `ABORTED`: The task was aborted.
      * `COMPLETED`: The task was successfully executed.
      * `FAILED`: The task failed.
      * `CANCELED`: The task has been canceled.

4. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `TASK_ID` value for the execution result of the partition transfer task.

   The `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view displays the historical partition transfer tasks of all tenants.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
   ```

   You must replace `1` with the `TASK_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

   The `STATUS` column in the query result indicates the execution result of the partition transfer task. Valid values:

   * `COMPLETED`: The task was successfully executed.

   * `FAILED`: The task failed. You can view the cause of the failure in the `COMMENT` column. The following information is common in the `COMMENT` field:

      * `LS not exist or may be in DROPPING/WAIT_OFFLINE status`: The destination log stream does not exist or is in the `DROPPING` or `WAITOFFLINE` state.
      * `LS status is not NORMAL or is in BLOCK_TABLET_IN state`: The destination log stream is not in the `NORMAL` state. For example, it may be in the `CREATING` or `CREATED` state, or the log stream is in the `BLOCK_TABLET_IN` state and cannot accept new partitions.
      * `Table has beed dropped`: The table of the partition to be transferred is deleted.
      * `Partition has beed dropped`: The partition to be transferred is deleted.
      * `Partition is already in dest LS`: The partition is already on the transfer destination.
      * `Need retry, partition may be dropped`: The partition is deleted when the transfer task is executed. The system will re-check whether the partition exists when generating the next load balancing task.
      * `Need retry, partition may be dropped or be transferred`: The partition does not exist when the transfer task is executed. The partition may have been deleted or no longer exist on the source log stream. The system will re-check whether the partition exists when generating the next load balancing task.

7. After successful execution of the partition transfer task, query the information about the partition again.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1006 AND DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'TBL1_LOG_R' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'M202005' LIMIT 1;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   |   500003 |    500009 |    200006 |  1003 |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The result shows that the `M202005` partition of the `TBL1_LOG_R` table in the `SYS` database has been transferred from log stream `1002` to log stream `1003`.

## Initiate a partition transfer from a user tenant

:::tab
tab MySQL mode

This section takes the `mysql_tenant` user tenant as an example.

1. Connect to the database as the tenant administrator of the MySQL tenant.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@mysql_tenant#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Confirm the partition information.

   Query the `DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS` view to obtain the values of `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` of the specified partition.

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a non-partitioned table

      Assume that `mysql_tenant` has a non-partitioned table named `t1`. Here is a query example:

      ```sql
      obclient [test]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'test' AND TABLE_NAME= 't1' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500002 |    500002 |    200001 |  1001 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a partitioned table

      You need to specify only the partition name for the query. Here is an example:

      Assume that `mysql_tenant` has a partitioned table named `tbl1_l`.

      ```sql
      obclient [test]> CREATE TABLE tbl1_l (col1 BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,col2 VARCHAR(50))
       PARTITION BY LIST(col1)
        (PARTITION p0 VALUES IN (1, 2, 3),
         PARTITION p1 VALUES IN (5, 6),
         PARTITION p2 VALUES IN (DEFAULT)
        );
      ```

      The following example shows how to query the `p1` partition of the partitioned table:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'test' AND TABLE_NAME= 'tbl1_l' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'p1' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500012 |    500014 |    200009 |  1001 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a subpartitioned table

      You need to specify both the partition and subpartition names for the query.

      Assume that `mysql_tenant` has a subpartitioned table named `t2_f_rclc`.

      ```sql
      obclient [test]> CREATE TABLE t2_f_rclc (col1 INT,col2 INT)
       PARTITION BY RANGE COLUMNS(col1)
       SUBPARTITION BY LIST COLUMNS(col2)
       (PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN(100)
         (SUBPARTITION sp0 VALUES IN(1,3),
          SUBPARTITION sp1 VALUES IN(4,6),
          SUBPARTITION sp2 VALUES IN(7,9)),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN(200)
         (SUBPARTITION sp3 VALUES IN(1,3),
          SUBPARTITION sp4 VALUES IN(4,6),
          SUBPARTITION sp5 VALUES IN(7,9))
       );
      ```

      The following example shows how to query the `sp3` subpartition in the subpartitioned table:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'test' AND TABLE_NAME= 't2_f_rclc' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'P1' AND SUBPARTITION_NAME = 'sp3' LIMIT 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500003 |    500009 |    200005 |  1002 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

3. Select the transfer destination.

   1. Query the `DBA_OB_LS` view to obtain the log stream status and information in the tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_LS;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      | LS_ID | STATUS | PRIMARY_ZONE | UNIT_GROUP_ID | LS_GROUP_ID | CREATE_SCN          | DROP_SCN | SYNC_SCN            | READABLE_SCN        | FLAG |
      +-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      |     1 | NORMAL | zone1        |             0 |           0 |                NULL |     NULL | 1701247658419109377 | 1701247658419109377 |      |
      |  1001 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1003 |        1001 | 1701239750437064613 |     NULL | 1701247658419109376 | 1701247658419109376 |      |
      |  1002 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1004 |        1002 | 1701239750441114919 |     NULL | 1701247658223204599 | 1701247658223204599 |      |
      |  1003 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1005 |        1003 | 1701239750443869478 |     NULL | 1701247659122731843 | 1701247659030755559 |      |
      +-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

   2. Query the `DBA_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view to obtain the tablet distribution on log streams.

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT LS_ID, COUNT(*) AS C FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLET_TO_LS GROUP BY LS_ID;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-------+------+
      | LS_ID | C    |
      +-------+------+
      |     1 |  590 |
      |  1001 |    4 |
      |  1002 |    3 |
      |  1003 |    3 |
      +-------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

      Select an appropriate log stream as the transfer destination based on the preceding information.

4. Execute the following statement to perform partition transfer:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] table_id, OBJECT_ID [=] object_id TO LS ls_id;
   ```

   where:

   * `table_id` indicates the ID of the table.

   * `object_id` indicates the unique ID of the partition.

   * `ls_id` indicates the ID of the destination log stream of the transfer.

   * `tenant_name` indicates the tenant to which the partition to be transferred belongs.

   The following example shows how to transfer the `p1` partition of the `tbl1_l` table in the `test` database of the `mysql_tenant` tenant from the current `1001` log stream to the `1003` log stream:

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID = 500012, OBJECT_ID = 500014 TO LS 1003;
   ```

5. After the partition transfer command is executed successfully, you can check the task status by querying the following views.

   1. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view to obtain the values of `TASK_ID`, `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, and `BALANCE_JOB_ID` of the task.

      The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view displays the ongoing partition transfer tasks in the current tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TASK_ID, BALANCE_JOB_ID, TRANSFER_TASK_ID, STATUS FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS WHERE TABLE_ID = 500012 AND OBJECT_ID = 500014;
      ```

      A sample query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      | TASK_ID | BALANCE_JOB_ID | TRANSFER_TASK_ID | STATUS |
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      |       1 |          26506 |                1 | DOING  |
      +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
      1 row in set
      ```

      The value of the `STATUS` field indicates the status of the task. Valid values:

      * `WAITING`: The task is waiting to be scheduled.
      * `INIT`: A load balancing job has been constructed for the task. You can view the execution progress of the load balancing job based on its `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.
      * `DOING`: The task is in progress. You can view the task based on `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, which will change several times. A partition transfer task involves multiple transfers.

      If the query of the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view returns an empty result, you can query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view to check the task result.

   2. Query the `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` or `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value to check the execution status of the associated load balancing job.

      The `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view displays the load balancing jobs that are being performed in the tenant. Each tenant can have only one running load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) at a time. A load balancing job generates multiple transfer tasks (TRANSFER_TASK). The `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view displays the history of load balancing jobs that have been performed in the tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS WHERE JOB_ID = 26506;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY WHERE JOB_ID = 26506;
      ```

      Replace `26506` with the obtained `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.

      The `STATUS` field in the query result indicates the execution status of the load balancing job. Valid values:

      * `DOING`: The load balancing job is in progress.
      * `COMPLETED`: The load balancing job was successfully executed.
      * `CANCELING`: The load balancing job is being canceled.
      * `CANCELED`: The load balancing job has been canceled.

   3. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` or `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value and check the execution status of the associated transfer task.

      The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` view displays the load balancing tasks that are being performed in the tenant. Multiple ongoing transfer tasks (TRANSFER_TASK) that belong to the same load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) can exist concurrently in a tenant. The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view displays the history of load balancing tasks that have been performed in the tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
      ```

      ```sql
      obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
      ```

      You must replace `1` with the `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

      The `STATUS` field in the query result indicates the execution status of the transfer task. Valid values:

      * `INIT`: The task is being created.
      * `START`: The task starts to be executed.
      * `DOING`: The task is in progress.
      * `ABORTED`: The task was aborted.
      * `COMPLETED`: The task was successfully executed.
      * `FAILED`: The task failed.
      * `CANCELED`: The transfer task is canceled.

4. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `TASK_ID` value to confirm the result of the partition transfer task.

   The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view displays the historical partition transfer tasks executed in the current tenant. A sample query is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
   ```

   You must replace `1` with the `TASK_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

   The `STATUS` field in the query result indicates the execution result of the partition transfer task. Valid values:

   * `COMPLETED`: The task was successfully executed.

   * `FAILED`: The task failed. You can view the cause of the failure in the `COMMENT` column. The following information is common in the `COMMENT` field:

      * `LS not exist or may be in DROPPING/WAIT_OFFLINE status`: The destination log stream does not exist or is in the `DROPPING` or `WAITOFFLINE` state.
      * `LS status is not NORMAL or is in BLOCK_TABLET_IN state`: The destination log stream is not in the `NORMAL` state. For example, it may be in the `CREATING` or `CREATED` state, or the log stream is in the `BLOCK_TABLET_IN` state and cannot accept new partitions.
      * `Table has been dropped`: The table of the partition to be transferred is deleted.
      * `Partition has been dropped`: The partition to be transferred is deleted.
      * `Partition is already in dest LS`: The partition is already on the transfer destination.
      * `Need retry, partition may be dropped`: The partition is deleted when the transfer task is executed. The system will re-check whether the partition exists when generating the next load balancing task.
      * `Need retry, partition may be dropped or be transferred`: The partition does not exist when the transfer task is executed. The partition may have been deleted or no longer exist on the source log stream. The system will re-check whether the partition exists when generating the next load balancing task.

6. After successful execution of the partition transfer task, query the information about the partition again.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'test' AND TABLE_NAME= 'tbl1_l' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'p1' LIMIT 1;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   |   500012 |    500014 |    200009 |  1003 |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The result shows that the `p1` partition of the `tbl1_l` table in the `test` database is transferred from the `1001` log stream to the `1003` log stream. The partition transfer operation succeeded.

tab Oracle mode

This section takes the `oracle_tenant` tenant as an example.

1. Connect to the database as the tenant administrator of the Oracle tenant.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -usys@oracle_tenant#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Confirm the partition information.

   Query the `DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS` view to obtain the values of `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` of the specified partition.

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a non-partitioned table

      Assume that non-partitioned table `T1` exists in the `oracle_tenant` tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T1' AND ROWNUM = 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500002 |    500002 |    200001 |  1001 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a partitioned table

      You need to specify only the partition name for the query. Here is an example:

      Assume that partitioned table `TBL1_LOG_R` exists in the `oracle_tenant` tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE tbl1_log_r(log_id INT,log_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT SYSDATE)
       PARTITION BY RANGE(log_date)
        (PARTITION M202001 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/02/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202002 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/03/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202003 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/04/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202004 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/05/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202005 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/06/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202006 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/07/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202007 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/08/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202008 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/09/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202009 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/10/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202010 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/11/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202011 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2020/12/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION M202012 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('2021/01/01','YYYY/MM/DD'))
         , PARTITION MMAX VALUES LESS THAN (MAXVALUE)
         );
      ```

      The following sample code queries related information about the `M202005` partition in the partitioned table.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'TBL1_LOG_R' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'M202005' AND ROWNUM = 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500003 |    500009 |    200006 |  1002 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

   * Query `TABLET_ID`, `OBJECT_ID`, and `LS_ID` values of a subpartitioned table

      You need to specify both the partition and subpartition names for the query.

      Assume that subpartitioned table `T2_F_RL` exists in the `oracle_tenant` tenant. A sample query is as follows:

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> CREATE TABLE t2_f_rl(col1 INT,col2 VARCHAR2(50))
       PARTITION BY RANGE(col1)
       SUBPARTITION BY LIST(col2)
       (PARTITION p0 VALUES LESS THAN(100)
         (SUBPARTITION sp0 VALUES('01'),
          SUBPARTITION sp1 VALUES('02')
          ),
        PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN(200)
         (SUBPARTITION sp2 VALUES('01'),
          SUBPARTITION sp3 VALUES('02'),
          SUBPARTITION sp4 VALUES('03')
         )
        );
      ```

      The following sample code queries related information about the `SP2` subpartition in the subpartitioned table.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T2_F_RL' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'P1' AND SUBPARTITION_NAME = 'SP2' AND ROWNUM = 1;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      |   500018 |    500023 |    200017 |  1003 |
      +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
      1 row in set
      ```

3. Select the transfer destination.

   1. Query the `DBA_OB_LS` view to obtain the log stream status and information in the tenant.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_LS;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      | TENANT_ID | LS_ID | STATUS | PRIMARY_ZONE | UNIT_GROUP_ID | LS_GROUP_ID | CREATE_SCN          | DROP_SCN | SYNC_SCN            | READABLE_SCN        | FLAG |
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      |      1006 |     1 | NORMAL | zone1        |             0 |           0 |                NULL |     NULL | 1701244663685197789 | 1701244663685197789 |      |
      |      1006 |  1001 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1006 |        1001 | 1701239786827662637 |     NULL | 1701244663685197789 | 1701244663685197789 |      |
      |      1006 |  1002 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1007 |        1002 | 1701239786831568305 |     NULL | 1701244664066906860 | 1701244664066906859 |      |
      |      1006 |  1003 | NORMAL | zone1        |          1008 |        1003 | 1701239786834300282 |     NULL | 1701244664175263949 | 1701244664175263948 |      |
      +-----------+-------+--------+--------------+---------------+-------------+---------------------+----------+---------------------+---------------------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

   2. Query the `DBA_OB_TABLET_TO_LS` view to obtain the tablet distribution on log streams.

      ```sql
      obclient [SYS]> SELECT LS_ID, COUNT(*) AS C FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TABLET_TO_LS GROUP BY LS_ID;
      ```

      The query result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-------+------+
      | LS_ID | C    |
      +-------+------+
      |     1 |  578 |
      |  1001 |    7 |
      |  1002 |    5 |
      |  1003 |    7 |
      +-------+------+
      4 rows in set
      ```

      Select an appropriate log stream as the transfer destination based on the preceding information.

4. Execute the following statement to perform partition transfer:

   ```sql
   ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] table_id, OBJECT_ID [=] object_id TO LS ls_id;
   ```

   where:

   * `table_id` indicates the ID of the table.

   * `object_id` indicates the unique ID of the partition.

   * `ls_id` indicates the ID of the destination log stream of the transfer.

   * `tenant_name` indicates the tenant to which the partition to be transferred belongs.

   The following example shows how to transfer the `M202005` partition of the `TBL1_LOG_R` table in the `SYS` database of the `oracle_tenant` tenant from the current `1002` log stream to the `1003` log stream:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> ALTER SYSTEM TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID = 500003, OBJECT_ID = 500009 TO LS 1003;
   ```

5. After the partition transfer command is executed successfully, you can check the task status by querying the following views.

1. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view to obtain the values of `TASK_ID`, `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, and `BALANCE_JOB_ID` of the task.

   The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view displays the ongoing partition transfer tasks in the current tenant. A sample query is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT TASK_ID, BALANCE_JOB_ID, TRANSFER_TASK_ID, STATUS FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS WHERE TABLE_ID = 500003 AND OBJECT_ID = 500009;
   ```

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
   | TASK_ID | BALANCE_JOB_ID | TRANSFER_TASK_ID | STATUS |
   +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
   |       1 |          17304 |                1 | DOING  |
   +---------+----------------+------------------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The value of the `STATUS` field indicates the status of the task. Valid values:

   * `WAITING`: The task is waiting to be scheduled.
   * `INIT`: A load balancing job has been constructed for the task. You can view the execution progress of the load balancing job based on its `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value.
   * `DOING`: The task is in progress. You can view the task based on `TRANSFER_TASK_ID`, which will change several times. A partition transfer task involves multiple transfers.

   If the query of the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view returns an empty result, you can query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view to check the task result.

2. Query the `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` or `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value to check the execution status of the associated load balancing job.

   The `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS` view displays the load balancing jobs that are being performed in the tenant. Each tenant can have only one running load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) at a time. A load balancing job generates multiple transfer tasks (TRANSFER_TASK). The `DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY` view displays the history of load balancing jobs that have been performed in the tenant. A sample query is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOBS WHERE JOB_ID = 17304;
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_BALANCE_JOB_HISTORY WHERE JOB_ID = 17304;
   ```

   You must replace `17304` with the `BALANCE_JOB_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

   The `STATUS` field in the query result indicates the execution status of the load balancing job. Valid values:

   * `DOING`: The load balancing job is in progress.
   * `COMPLETED`: The load balancing job was successfully executed.
   * `CANCELING`: The load balancing job is being canceled.
   * `CANCELED`: The load balancing job has been canceled.

3. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` or `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value and check the execution status of the associated transfer task.

   The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS` view displays the load balancing tasks that are being performed in the tenant. Multiple ongoing transfer tasks (TRANSFER_TASK) that belong to the same load balancing job (BALANCE_JOB) can exist concurrently in a tenant. The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY` view displays the history of load balancing tasks that have been performed in the tenant. A sample query is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASKS WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
   ```

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
   ```

   You must replace `1` with the `TRANSFER_TASK_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

   The `STATUS` field in the query result indicates the execution status of the transfer task. Valid values:

   * `INIT`: The task is being created.
   * `START`: The task starts to be executed.
   * `DOING`: The task is in progress.
   * `ABORTED`: The task was aborted.
   * `COMPLETED`: The task was successfully executed.
   * `FAILED`: The task failed.
   * `CANCELED`: The transfer task is canceled.

4. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view based on the obtained `TASK_ID` value to confirm the result of the partition transfer task.

   The `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY` view displays the historical partition transfer tasks executed in the current tenant. A sample query is as follows:

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASK_HISTORY WHERE TASK_ID = 1;
   ```

   You must replace `1` with the `TASK_ID` value obtained in previous steps.

   The `STATUS` field in the query result indicates the execution result of the partition transfer task. Valid values:

   * `COMPLETED`: The task was successfully executed.

   * `FAILED`: The task failed. You can view the cause of the failure in the `COMMENT` column. The following information is common in the `COMMENT` field:

      * `LS not exist or may be in DROPPING/WAIT_OFFLINE status`: The destination log stream does not exist or is in the `DROPPING` or `WAITOFFLINE` state.
      * `LS status is not NORMAL or is in BLOCK_TABLET_IN state`: The destination log stream is not in the `NORMAL` state. For example, it may be in the `CREATING` or `CREATED` state, or the log stream is in the `BLOCK_TABLET_IN` state and cannot accept new partitions.
      * `Table has been dropped`: The table of the partition to be transferred is deleted.
      * `Partition has been dropped`: The partition to be transferred is deleted.
      * `Partition is already in dest LS`: The partition is already on the transfer destination.
      * `Need retry, partition may be dropped`: The partition is deleted when the transfer task is executed. The system will re-check whether the partition exists when generating the next load balancing task.
      * `Need retry, partition may be dropped or be transferred`: The partition does not exist when the transfer task is executed. The partition may have been deleted or no longer exist on the source log stream. The system will re-check whether the partition exists when generating the next load balancing task.

6. After successful execution of the partition transfer task, query the information about the partition again.

   ```sql
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT TABLE_ID AS TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, TABLET_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TABLE_LOCATIONS WHERE DATABASE_NAME = 'SYS' AND TABLE_NAME= 'T2_F_RL' AND PARTITION_NAME = 'P1' AND SUBPARTITION_NAME = 'SP2' AND ROWNUM = 1;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | TABLET_ID | LS_ID |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   |   500003 |    500009 |    200006 |  1003 |
   +----------+-----------+-----------+-------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   The result shows that the `M202005` partition of the `TBL1_LOG_R` table in the `SYS` database has been transferred from log stream `1002` to log stream `1003`.
