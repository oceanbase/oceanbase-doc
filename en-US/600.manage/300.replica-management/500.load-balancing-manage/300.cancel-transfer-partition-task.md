# Cancel a partition transfer task

You can cancel a manually initiated partition transfer task based on your business needs.

## Limitations

* You cannot cancel a partition transfer task that is in the `DOING` state, but cancellation is allowed for tasks in other states.

* You can cancel partition transfer tasks only in primary databases or tenants.

## Cancel a partition transfer task in the `sys` tenant

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Query the `CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view for the status of the current task.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TENANT_ID, TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, STATUS FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS WHERE TENANT_ID = 1002;
   ```

   The query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +-----------+----------+-----------+---------+
   | TENANT_ID | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | STATUS  |
   +-----------+----------+-----------+---------+
   |      1002 |   500006 |    500008 | WAITING |
   +-----------+----------+-----------+---------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   If the value of the `STATUS` field in the query result is not `DOING`, but is, for example, `WAITING` or `INIT`, the task can be canceled.

   If you want to cancel a partition transfer task in the `DOING` state, you can set the tenant-level parameter `enable_transfer` to `false` to disable transfer. After transfer is disabled, all partition transfer tasks in the `DOING` state will be rolled back to the `WAITING` state and can be canceled.

   For more information about the `enable_transfer` parameter, see [enable_transfer](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/3000.enable_transfer.md).

3. Perform either of the following operations based on the query result:

   * Cancel the partition transfer task for a specified partition in a specified tenant

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] table_id OBJECT_ID [=] object_id TENANT = 'tenant_name';
      ```

      where:

      * `table_id` indicates the ID of the table for which the partition transfer task is to be canceled.

      * `object_id` indicates the ID of the partition for which the partition transfer task is to be canceled.

      * `tenant_name` indicates the name of the tenant for which the partition transfer task is to be canceled.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID = 500006, OBJECT_ID = 500008 TENANT = 'mysql_tenant';
      ```

   * Cancel all partition transfer tasks in a specified tenant

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION ALL TENANT = 'tenant_name';
      ```

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION ALL TENANT = 'mysql_tenant';
      ```

## Cancel a partition transfer task in a user tenant

1. Connect to the database as the tenant administrator of a MySQL or Oracle tenant.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding parameters in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@mysql_tenant#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

2. Query the `DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS` view for the status of the current task.

   :::tab
   tab MySQL mode

   The query statement in MySQL mode is as follows:

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, STATUS FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS;
   ```

   tab Oracle mode

   The query statement in Oracle mode is as follows:

   ```shell
   obclient [SYS]> SELECT TABLE_ID, OBJECT_ID, STATUS FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TRANSFER_PARTITION_TASKS;
   ```

   :::

   A sample query result is as follows:

   ```shell
   +----------+-----------++--------+
   | TABLE_ID | OBJECT_ID | STATUS |
   +----------+-----------+--------+
   |   500046 |    500052 | INIT   |
   +----------+-----------+--------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   If the value of the `STATUS` field in the query result is not `DOING`, but is, for example, `WAITING` or `INIT`, the task can be canceled.

   If you want to cancel a partition transfer task in the `DOING` state, you can set the tenant-level parameter `enable_transfer` to `false` to disable transfer. After transfer is disabled, all partition transfer tasks in the `DOING` state will be rolled back to the `WAITING` state and can be canceled.

   For more information about the `enable_transfer` parameter, see [enable_transfer](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/3000.enable_transfer.md).

3. Perform either of the following operations based on the query result:

   * Cancel the partition transfer task for a specified partition in the current tenant

      ```sql
      ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID [=] table_id OBJECT_ID [=] object_id;
      ```

      where:

      * `table_id` indicates the ID of the table for which the partition transfer task is to be canceled.

      * `object_id` indicates the ID of the partition for which the partition transfer task is to be canceled.

      Here is an example:

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION TABLE_ID = 500046, OBJECT_ID = 500052;
      ```

   * Cancel all partition transfer tasks in the current tenant

      ```shell
      obclient> ALTER SYSTEM CANCEL TRANSFER PARTITION ALL;
      ```
