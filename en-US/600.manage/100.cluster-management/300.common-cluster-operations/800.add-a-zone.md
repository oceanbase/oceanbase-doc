# Add a zone

You can add a zone to scale out a cluster.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding options in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to a database, see [Connection methods (MySQL mode)](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) or [Connection methods (Oracle mode)](../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Execute the following statement to add a zone to a cluster:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM ADD ZONE zone_name [IDC [=] 'idc_name', REGION [=] 'region_name', ZONE_TYPE [=] 'ReadWrite'];
   ```

   where

   * `zone_name` specifies the name of the zone to be added. This statement adds only one zone at a time. To add multiple zones, execute this statement repeatedly.

   * `idc_name` specifies the name of the IDC where the zone is located. The default value is Null.

   * `region_name` specifies the name of the region where the zone is located. The default value is the value of `default_region`.

   * `ZONE_TYPE` specifies the type of the zone. At present, only a read-write zone is supported. The default value is `ReadWrite`. If you do not specify this parameter, the default value is used.

   To add a zone named zone4 to the cluster, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM ADD ZONE zone4 IDC 'hz1', REGION 'hangzhou';
   ```

3. After the statement is executed, you can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES` view to verify whether the zone is added.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | ZONE  | CREATE_TIME                | MODIFY_TIME                | STATUS   | IDC | REGION   | TYPE      |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | zone1 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.801054 | ACTIVE   | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone2 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.809504 | ACTIVE   | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone3 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.169804 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.815833 | ACTIVE   | SH0 | shanghai | ReadWrite |
   | zone4 | 2023-01-06 14:57:18.775946 | 2023-01-06 14:57:18.776974 | INACTIVE | hz1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+----------+-----+----------+-----------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

   If the zone appears in the query result, it is successfully added. A newly added zone is in the `INACTIVE` state.

   For more information about the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES` view, see [oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/24300.o-dba_ob_zones-of-sys-tenant.md).

4. To use a newly added zone, you must start it so that it changes to the `ACTIVE` state.

   Here is a sample statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone_name;
   ```

   In the statement, `zone_name` specifies the name of the zone to be started.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone4;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected

   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | ZONE  | CREATE_TIME                | MODIFY_TIME                | STATUS | IDC | REGION   | TYPE      |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | zone1 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.801054 | ACTIVE | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone2 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.809504 | ACTIVE | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone3 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.169804 | 2023-01-30 17:34:11.228474 | ACTIVE | HZ1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone4 | 2023-01-06 15:30:30.887362 | 2023-01-31 13:47:56.107429 | ACTIVE | hz1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

   After the zone is started, its status changes to `ACTIVE`.

## What to do next

* After you add a zone, you can modify its `idc_name` or `region_name`. For more information about how to modify a zone, see [Modify a zone](../300.common-cluster-operations/1000.modify-a-zone.md).

* To use a newly added zone, you must first add nodes to the zone. For more information about how to add a node, see [Add a node](../300.common-cluster-operations/400.add-a-node.md).

* A newly added zone is in the `INACTIVE` state. To enable nodes in the zone to provide services, you must start the zone. For more information about how to start a zone, see [Start a zone](../300.common-cluster-operations/800.1.start-a-zone.md).
