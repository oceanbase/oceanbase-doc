# Start a zone

You can start a zone to enable all servers in the zone to provide services.

## Background information

You can start a zone in the following scenarios:

* If you add a new zone and it is in the `INACTIVE` state, you can start the zone to use the servers in this zone.

* If the current zone is isolated due to business reasons and the zone is in the `INACTIVE` state, you can start the zone to cancel its isolation.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding options in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to a database, see [Connection methods (MySQL mode)](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) or [Connection methods (Oracle mode)](../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Execute the following statement to start the zone:


   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone_name;
   ```

   In the statement, `zone_name` specifies the name of the zone to be started. This statement starts only one zone at a time.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM START ZONE zone4;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. After the statement is executed, you can query the `DBA_OB_ZONES` view to verify whether the zone is started.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | ZONE  | CREATE_TIME                | MODIFY_TIME                | STATUS | IDC | REGION   | TYPE      |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | zone1 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.801054 | ACTIVE | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone2 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.809504 | ACTIVE | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone3 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.169804 | 2023-01-30 17:34:11.228474 | ACTIVE | HZ1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone4 | 2023-01-06 15:30:30.887362 | 2023-01-31 13:47:56.107429 | ACTIVE | hz1 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   4 rows in set
   ```

   The query result shows that the status of the zone is changed from `INACTIVE` to `ACTIVE`, indicating that the zone is started.
