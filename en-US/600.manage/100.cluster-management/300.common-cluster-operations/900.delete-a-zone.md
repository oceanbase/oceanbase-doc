# Delete a zone

You can delete a zone to scale in a cluster.

## Prerequisites

Before you delete a zone, make sure that:

* The zone contains no nodes. For more information about how to view the nodes in a zone, see [View a node](../300.common-cluster-operations/200.view-an-observer.md).

* The zone is stopped.

   You can execute the following statement to stop a zone:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM STOP ZONE zone_name;
   ```

   In the statement, `zone_name` specifies the name of the zone to be stopped. This statement stops only one zone at a time.

   Here is an example:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM STOP ZONE zone4;
   ```

## Procedure

1. Log on to the `sys` tenant of the cluster as the `root` user.

   Note that you must specify the corresponding options in the following sample code based on your actual database configurations.

   ```shell
   obclient -h10.xx.xx.xx -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p***** -A
   ```

   For more information about how to connect to a database, see [Connection methods (MySQL mode)](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md) or [Connection methods (Oracle mode)](../../../300.develop/200.application-development-of-oracle-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-oracle-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

2. Execute the following statement to delete a zone from a cluster:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE ZONE zone_name;
   ```

   In the statement, `zone_name` specifies the name of the zone to be deleted. This statement deletes only one zone at a time. To delete multiple zones, execute this statement repeatedly.

   For example, to delete a zone named `zone4` from the cluster, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> ALTER SYSTEM DELETE ZONE zone4;
   ```

3. After the statement is executed, you can query the `oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES` view to verify whether the zone is deleted.

   ```shell
   obclient [(none)]> SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_ZONES;
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | ZONE  | CREATE_TIME                | MODIFY_TIME                | STATUS | IDC | REGION   | TYPE      |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   | zone1 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.801054 | ACTIVE | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone2 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.168745 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.809504 | ACTIVE | HZ0 | hangzhou | ReadWrite |
   | zone3 | 2022-12-20 17:50:17.169804 | 2022-12-20 17:50:40.815833 | ACTIVE | SH0 | shanghai | ReadWrite |
   +-------+----------------------------+----------------------------+--------+-----+----------+-----------+
   3 rows in set
   ```

   If this zone does not appear in the query result, the zone is successfully deleted.
