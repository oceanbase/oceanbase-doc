# Overview

* OceanBase Database provides various methods to identify exceptions, such as monitoring metrics, system logs, and trace logs, and notifies you of an exception by using multiple methods at the same time. This way, you can identify an exception even when some methods are inaccessible. Each method provides information from a unique perspective. Therefore, you can use multiple methods as needed to comprehensively identify and understand exceptions.

* Errors are rarely isolated. By the time an error is detected in a system, it is likely that many exceptions have occurred in other parts of the system. To resolve detected errors, you need to understand the exact meaning of exceptions that have occurred to pick up the key information, and drill down and trace back to the root causes.

* OceanBase Database supports end-to-end tracing. This feature allows you to quickly determine whether a timeout is caused by OceanBase Database components or network issues, despite the complex service traces.
