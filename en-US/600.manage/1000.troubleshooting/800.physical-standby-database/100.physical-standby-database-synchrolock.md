# Log synchronization stuck for the physical standby database

This topic describes how to locate and troubleshoot issues that occur when log synchronization is stuck for the physical standby database.

## Issue 1: The `RECOVER` command is not executed, the `RECOVER` command is executed to restore the tenant to a specified end point, or the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER xxx CANCEL` command has been executed

### Symptom

* After you restore a standby tenant through physical restore, if you do not execute the `RECOVER` command to specify a new restore end point for the standby tenant, the log synchronization for the standby tenant is stuck when log streams are restored to the previously specified end point.
* After you restore a standby tenant through physical restore, if you run the `RECOVER` command to specify a restore end point for the standby tenant, the log synchronization for the standby tenant is stuck when log streams are restored to the specified end point.
* After you restore a standby tenant through physical restore, if you run the `RECOVER` command and then the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER xxx CANCEL` command, the log synchronization for the standby tenant is stuck when log streams are restored to the specified end point.

### Possible causes

Generally, after you restore a standby tenant through physical restore, if you do not execute the `RECOVER` command or if you execute the `RECOVER` command to restore the standby tenant to a specified end point, the log synchronization for the standby tenant will stop at the specified restore end point. If you execute the `RECOVER` command and then the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER xxx CANCEL` command on the standby tenant, the log synchronization for the standby tenant will also stop at the specified restore end point.

As shown in the following example, the role of the `restore_oracle_tenant` tenant is `STANDBY` and the synchronization progress is stuck at a point in time. This is because you did not execute the `RECOVER` command, you executed the `RECOVER` command restore the standby tenant to a specified end point, or you executed the `ALTER SYSTEM RECOVER xxx CANCEL` command after the `RECOVER` command. When the synchronization checkpoint `SYNC_SCN` equals the restorable checkpoint `RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN`, no more logs need to be synchronized for the standby tenant.

```shell
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                     TENANT_ID: 1002
                   TENANT_NAME: restore_oracle_tenant
                   TENANT_ROLE: STANDBY
                        STATUS: NORMAL
             SWITCHOVER_STATUS: NORMAL
                      SYNC_SCN: 1690425747241344851
                REPLAYABLE_SCN: 1690425747241344851
                  READABLE_SCN: 1690425747241344851
            RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN: 1690425747241344851
1 row in set
```

### Troubleshooting procedure

Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view for the synchronization checkpoint.

1. Log on as the administrator to the problematic tenant or the sys tenant of the cluster to which the problematic tenant belongs.

2. Query the basic status information of the problematic tenant, such as the role and synchronization checkpoint of the tenant, based on its `TENANT_ID` or `TENANT_NAME` value.

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS, SWITCHOVER_STATUS, SYNC_SCN, REPLAYABLE_SCN,READABLE_SCN, RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS, SWITCHOVER_STATUS, SYNC_SCN, REPLAYABLE_SCN,READABLE_SCN, RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS, SWITCHOVER_STATUS, SYNC_SCN, REPLAYABLE_SCN,READABLE_SCN, RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      :::

   Pay attention to values in the following columns in the query result:

   * `TENANT_ROLE`: the role of the tenant. `STANDBY` indicates a standby tenant and `PRIMARY` indicates a primary tenant.
   * `SYNC_SCN`: the synchronization checkpoint of the tenant.
   * `REPLAYABLE_SCN`: the replayable checkpoint of the tenant. Logs whose SCNs are greater than this checkpoint cannot be replayed.
   * `RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN`: the end point to which the tenant can be restored. The value `4611686018427387903` indicates infinity.

   For more information about the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/23100.o-dba_ob_tenants-of-sys-tenant.md).

## Issue 2: No log restore source is configured for the tenant, or the log restore source is empty or damaged

### Symptom

* After a standby tenant is created by using the `BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG` statement, no log restore source is configured, or the configured log restore source is empty. For example, an empty log source is configured by using the `ALTER SYSTEM SET log_restore_source = '';` statement.
* The log restore source is cleared for the standby tenant.
* After the primary tenant is switched to the STANDBY role, no log restore source is configured for it.

### Possible causes

In OceanBase Database, a standby tenant pulls logs from the log restore source. By default, after you run the `RECOVER` command on a standby tenant that is created by using the physical backup and restore feature, the standby tenant continues to synchronize logs from the archive directory specified during the restore. By default, a standby tenant created by using the `CREATE STANDBY TENANT` statement directly synchronizes logs from the primary tenant over the network. Continuous log synchronization cannot be directly enabled for a standby tenant created by using the `BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG` statement because no log restore source is specified for the tenant.

In addition, if the log restore source of a standby tenant is empty or damaged, log synchronization of the standby tenant will also be stuck. For example, if the primary tenant is deleted or the password of the replication account used to access the primary tenant is changed for a network-based physical standby database, or the log archive directory used to restore logs for an archive-based physical standby database is deleted, log synchronization of the standby tenant will be stuck.

### Troubleshooting procedure

You can query the `CDB_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` or `DBA_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` view to verify whether a log restore source is configured for the problematic tenant.

1. Log on as the administrator to the problematic tenant or the sys tenant of the cluster to which the problematic tenant belongs.

2. Verify whether a log restore source is configured for the problematic tenant.

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.CDB_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE WHERE TENANT_ID=1xxx;
      ```

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE;
      ```

      :::

   Pay attention to values in the following columns in the query result:

   * `TYPE`: The type of the physical standby database. The value `LOCATION` indicates an archive-based physical standby database, in which the current tenant synchronizes logs from the source tenant through archive logs. The value `SERVICE` indicates a network-based physical standby database, in which the current tenant directly synchronizes logs from the primary tenant over the network. You can execute the `ALTER SYSTEM SET log_restore_source` statement to change the log restore source of the standby tenant.

   * `VALUE`: The value of this field corresponds to that of `TYPE`, and can be the log archive directory of the source tenant or the access point of the primary tenant.

   In the following sample query result, if the log restore source of the `restore_oracle_tenant` tenant is empty, no log restore source is configured for this tenant. In this case, log synchronization of the standby tenant will be stuck. If the value of `VALUE` is the log archive directory of the source tenant, you must verify whether the log archive directory is accessible from all servers of the primary and standby tenants. If the value of `VALUE` is the access point of the primary tenant, you must verify whether the IP address list, username, and password are correctly configured.

   ```shell
   *************************** 1. row ***************************
                      tenant_id: 1002
                           type: LOCATION
                          value: file:///data/1
             recovery_until_scn: 4611686018427387903
   1 row in set
   ```

   For more information about the `CDB_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` and `DBA_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE` views, see [CDB_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/300.system-view-of-sys-tenant/200.dictionary-view-of-sys-tenant/9300.o-cdb_ob_log_restore_source-of-sys-tenant.md) and [DBA_OB_LOG_RESTORE_SOURCE](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/13500.dba_ob_log_restore_source-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Issue 3: The log synchronization of the standby tenant is abnormal

### Symptom

Issue 1 and Issue 2 do not exist, but the log synchronization of the standby tenant is still abnormal.

### Possible causes

The logs of the standby tenant may lag behind or the log synchronization may be stuck due to reasons such as log stream recycling of the primary tenant or network factors.
### Troubleshooting procedure

The `V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS` view aggregates the synchronization status information of all log streams. You can query this view to check the synchronization status of all log streams.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>The <code>V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS</code> view displays the synchronization status information of only log stream leaders. Therefore, if a log stream of the standby tenant has no leader, you cannot query this view for the log synchronization status of this log stream. In this case, you must first troubleshoot the issue of leader absence. </p>
</main>

1. Log on as the administrator to the problematic tenant or the sys tenant of the cluster to which the problematic tenant belongs.

2. Query the synchronization status of all log stream leaders of the problematic tenant.

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS WHERE TENANT_ID=1xxx;
      ```

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM SYS.V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS;
      ```

      :::

      Pay attention to values in the following columns in the query result:

      * `SYNC_SCN`: the synchronization checkpoint of the log stream.

      * `SYNC_STATUS`: the synchronization status of the log stream. The value `NORMAL` indicates that the log synchronization of the log stream is normal. Other values indicate abnormal log synchronization. The following table describes the log synchronization states.

      For more information about the `V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS` view, see [V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/300.performance-view-of-mysql-mode/14200.v-ob_ls_log_restore_status-of-mysql-mode.md).

   | Log synchronization state | Description |
   |------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | NORMAL | Log synchronization is properly in progress. |
   | SOURCE HAS A GAP | A gap exists between the logs of the standby tenant and those of the source tenant. This is because logs of the primary tenant are recycled before being synchronized to the standby tenant. |
   | STANDBY LOG NOT MATCH | The restored logs conflict with those of the standby tenant. This is because two primary tenants exist or the log restore source is incorrectly configured. |
   | CHECK USER OR PASSWORD | The username or password of the replication account is incorrect and therefore cannot be used to access the original primary tenant. |
   | CHECK NETWORK | The primary tenant is unreachable. In this case, you need to check for network exceptions. |
   | RESTORE SUSPEND | The standby tenant has been restored to the specified checkpoint. |
   | STANDBY NEED UPGRADE | The binary version of the standby tenant lags behind and must be upgraded. |
   | PRIMARY TENANT DROPPED | The primary tenant is dropped. |
   | FETCH LOG TIMEOUT | Log synchronization timed out. In this case, you need to check the network health status or increase the value of the tenant-level parameter `standby_db_fetch_log_rpc_timeout` of the standby tenant. The `standby_db_fetch_log_rpc_timeout` parameter specifies the log synchronization timeout period. For more information about the parameter, see [standby_db_fetch_log_rpc_timeout](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/400.tenant-level-configuration-items/7600.standby_db_fetch_log_rpc_timeout.md). |
   | STANDBY IN THROTTLING | Write throttling is enabled for the standby tenant. |
   | STANDBY LOG DISK IS FULL | The disk space of the standby tenant is insufficient. |
   | WAIT LOG STREAM CREATED | Log streams are being created for the standby tenant. |
   | NOT AVAILABLE | Log synchronization is unavailable due to other exceptions. |

## Issue 4: The synchronization checkpoint of the standby tenant stops advancing

### Symptom

Issue 1, Issue 2, and Issue 3 do not exist, but the log synchronization of the standby tenant is still stuck. In this case, you can try to verify whether the synchronization checkpoint of the standby tenant stops advancing.

### Possible causes

All logs are restored in a synchronized manner across log streams of the standby tenant. Therefore, all log streams will check the `SYNC_SCN` value of the tenant and pull logs in advance based on the specified strategy. Log synchronization stops if the `SYNC_SCN` value of the tenant stops advancing, and resumes until the `SYNC_SCN` value of the tenant continues to advance.

### Troubleshooting procedure

1. Log on as the administrator to the problematic tenant or the sys tenant of the cluster to which the problematic tenant belongs.

2. Query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view for the `SYNC_SCN` value of the tenant, which specifies the synchronization checkpoint.

   You can query the `SYNC_SCN` value of the problematic tenant based on its `TENANT_ID` or `TENANT_NAME` value.

   * Query the `SYNC_SCN` value of the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS, SWITCHOVER_STATUS, SYNC_SCN, REPLAYABLE_SCN,READABLE_SCN, RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

   * Query the `SYNC_SCN` value of the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS, SWITCHOVER_STATUS, SYNC_SCN, REPLAYABLE_SCN,READABLE_SCN, RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS, SWITCHOVER_STATUS, SYNC_SCN, REPLAYABLE_SCN,READABLE_SCN, RECOVERY_UNTIL_SCN FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      :::

   Pay attention to values in the following columns in the query result:

   * `TENANT_ROLE`: the role of the tenant. `STANDBY` indicates a standby tenant and `PRIMARY` indicates a primary tenant.
   * `SYNC_SCN`: the synchronization checkpoint of the tenant.

3. Query the `V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS` view for the `SYNC_SCN` values of all log stream leaders.

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS WHERE TENANT_ID=1xxx;
      ```

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM oceanbase.V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT * FROM SYS.V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS;
      ```

      :::

      Pay attention to the `SYNC_SCN` column in the query result, which indicates the synchronization checkpoints of log streams.

      Compare the `SYNC_SCN` values of all log streams with that of the tenant based on the query results. If the `SYNC_SCN` values of all log streams are greater than that of the tenant and remain unchanged, the recorded log synchronization progress of the tenant is incorrect. In this case, you need to troubleshoot this issue.

      For more information about the `V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS` view, see [V$OB_LS_LOG_RESTORE_STATUS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/300.performance-view-of-mysql-mode/14200.v-ob_ls_log_restore_status-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Issue 5: A log stream of the standby tenant has no leader

### Symptom

The preceding issues do not exist, but the log synchronization of the standby tenant is still stuck. In this case, you can try to check whether a log stream of the standby tenant has no leader.

### Possible causes

During log synchronization, a log stream leader in the standby tenant first synchronizes logs from the primary tenant or archive media and then synchronizes the logs to other log stream replicas. If a log stream of the standby tenant has no leader, the log stream cannot synchronize logs and the tenant-level `SYNC_SCN` value cannot advance. As a result, the log synchronization of all log streams is stuck.

### Troubleshooting procedure

You can query the `GV$OB_LOG_STAT` view to check whether any log stream of the standby tenant has no leader.

1. Log on as the administrator to the problematic tenant or the sys tenant of the cluster to which the problematic tenant belongs.

2. Query the `GV$OB_LOG_STAT` view for the status information of all log streams of the tenant.

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, LS_ID, ROLE FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE TENANT_ID=1xxx;
      ```

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, LS_ID, ROLE FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT;
      ```

      You can also execute the following statement to query all log streams without a leader.

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE (TENANT_ID, LS_ID) NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE ROLE='LEADER');
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, LS_ID, ROLE FROM SYS.GV$OB_LOG_STAT;
      ```

      You can also execute the following statement to query all log streams without a leader.

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE (TENANT_ID, LS_ID) NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE ROLE='LEADER');
      ```

      :::

   Fields in the query result are described as follows:

   * `TENANT_ID`: the ID of the tenant.
   * `LS_ID`: the ID of the log stream.
   * `ROLE`: the role of the log stream replica. The value `LEADER` indicates that the log stream replica is a leader. The value `FOLLOWER` indicates that the log stream replica is a follower.

      If the roles of all log stream replicas are `FOLLOWER`, the log stream has no leader.

   You can also execute the following statements to query all log streams without a leader.

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE (TENANT_ID, LS_ID) NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE ROLE='LEADER');
      ```

   * Query information about the problematic tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE (TENANT_ID, LS_ID) NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM oceanbase.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE ROLE='LEADER');
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE (TENANT_ID, LS_ID) NOT IN (SELECT DISTINCT TENANT_ID, LS_ID FROM SYS.GV$OB_LOG_STAT WHERE ROLE='LEADER');
      ```

      :::

   For more information about the `GV$OB_LOG_STAT` view, see [GV$OB_LOG_STAT](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/300.performance-view-of-mysql-mode/1300.gv-ob_log_stat-of-mysql-mode.md).

   When the query result indicates that all log streams of the standby tenant has a leader, you can check whether any log stream of the primary tenant has no leader in the same way. The leader absence of any log stream of the primary tenant will also cause log synchronization to be stuck for log streams in the standby tenant.

## Issue 6: The roles of both the primary and standby tenants are `STANDBY`

### Symptom

In a scenario without cascaded standby databases, the role of at least one of the two tenants in the primary/standby relationship must be `PRIMARY`. Otherwise, log synchronization between the two tenants will be stuck.

### Possible causes

After you perform a switchover to change the role of the primary tenant to STANDBY, the roles of the original primary and standby tenants are both `STADNBY`.

### Troubleshooting procedure

You can query the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view to check whether the roles of the primary and standby tenants are both `STANDBY`.

1. Log on as the administrator to the primary and standby tenants respectively or to the sys tenant of the clusters where the primary and standby tenants belong.

2. Execute the following statements to query the roles of the primary and standby tenants.

   * Query the role of the primary or standby tenant from the sys tenant

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

   * Query the role of the primary or standby tenant from the current tenant

      :::tab
      tab  MySQL mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS FROM oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      tab Oracle mode

      The SQL syntax is as follows:

      ```sql
      SELECT TENANT_ID, TENANT_NAME, TENANT_ROLE, STATUS FROM SYS.DBA_OB_TENANTS;
      ```

      :::

   Fields in the query result are described as follows:

   * `TENANT_ID`: the ID of the tenant.
   * `TENANT_NAME`: the name of the tenant.
   * `TENANT_ROLE`: the role of the tenant. The value `PRIMARY` indicates a primary tenant and the value `STANDBY` indicates a standby tenant.

   Check whether the roles of the primary and standby tenants are both `STANDBY` in the query result.

   For more information about the `DBA_OB_TENANTS` view, see [DBA_OB_TENANTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/12300.o-dba_ob_tenants-of-mysql-mode.md).
