# Search for the logs of a specific SQL request

OceanBase Database allows you to search for logs related to specific SQL requests. However, depending on the syslog level settings and the SQL exceptions, you may not always find the logs that you need.

Searching for logs related to specific SQL requests is a highly useful technique in observability. The basic technique involves retrieving logs from the log files by using the IP address of the node and the TRACE_ID, allowing us to establish a full chain of events to identify the initial occurrence. This technique stands out for its "post-event" and "end-to-end" attributes, providing a powerful complement to metrics. Metrics help you notice exceptions, while syslogs provide you with details for end-to-end tracing.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OceanBase cluster and execute the following sample SQL statement, which will return an error:

   ```shell
   obclient> select timestamp'0001-01-33';
   ERROR 1525 (HY000): Incorrect DATETIME value: '0001-01-33'
   ```

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>In a real production environment, SQL statements are executed by the application system, and in the case of an exception, such as when an error code is returned, or the execution consumes a long time, contact O&amp;M engineers to help locate the causes. </p>
    </main>

2. Log on to the sys tenant and query the `GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT` view to check the execution information about the SQL statement.

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>If the <code>GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT</code> view does not return any result, check whether the <code>enable_sql_audit</code> parameter is set to <code>False</code>, which means that the SQL Audit feature is disabled. For more information about the <code>enable_sql_audit</code> parameter, see <a href="../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/8600.enable_sql_audit.md">enable_sql_audit</a>. </p>
    </main>

   ```shell
   obclient> select * from gv$ob_sql_audit where query_sql like '%select timestamp%' limit 1\G

   The preceding query result shows the `TRACE_ID` of the SQL request and the IP address of the node where it is executed.

   ```
   SVR_IP: xx.xx.xx.158
   TRACE_ID: YB4206019C9E-0005F55950FFAF04-0-0
   ```

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>In this example, the IP address of the node and TRACE_ID are obtained by using the <code>GV$OB_SQL_AUDIT</code> view. OceanBase Database also allows you to obtain that information by using other methods, such as using the logs of OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP) or the views of wait events. </p>
    </main>

3. Log on to the target node and search the log file by using `TRACE_ID`.

   ```
   [hellodba@xx.xx.xx.158 /home/admin/oceanbase/log]
   $ grep 'YB4206019C9E-0005F55950FFAF04-0-0' observer.log
   [2023-03-12 14:47:40.670100] WARN  resolve_const (ob_resolver_utils.cpp:2420) [116987][T1_TNT_L0_G0][T1][YB4206019C9E-0005F55950FFAF04-0-0] [lt=21] Incorrect DATETIME value: '0001-01-33'
   [2023-03-12 14:47:40.670205] WARN  resolve_const (ob_resolver_utils.cpp:2420) [116987][T1_TNT_L0_G0][T1][YB4206019C9E-0005F55950FFAF04-0-0] [lt=37] Incorrect DATETIME value: '0001-01-33'
   ```

    <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>If you cannot find the relevant logs by grepping in <code>observer.log</code>, it could be because the <code>observer.log</code> file has been rotated. In such cases, you can use the following command to grep through the rotated log files: <code>grep YB4206019C9E-0005F55950FFAF04-0-0 observer.log.*</code>. </p>
    </main>

   After you find the logs related to the `TRACE_ID`, you can analyze them as follows:

   * Analyze the node based on various information such as log context, OS metrics, and OS events.
   * Perform end-to-end tracing to analyze the related OBServer nodes, ODP nodes, and application nodes based on the remote procedure calls (RPCs) associated with the `TRACE_ID`.
