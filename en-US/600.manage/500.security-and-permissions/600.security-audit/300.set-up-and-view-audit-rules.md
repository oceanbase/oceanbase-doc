# Set and view audit rules

After you enable security audit, it is necessary to set specific audit rules to audit user operations.

## Limitations

Currently, only the Oracle mode of OceanBase Database supports the security audit feature.

## Set audit rules

Log on to an Oracle tenant as the `ORAAUDITOR` user and set the following types of audit rules:

* Statement audit: Audits specific operations without specifying specific objects. It can be applied to specific users or all users.
* Object audit: Audits specific operations that are performed on specific objects. It can be applied to specific users or all users.

An audit rule is also a schema object. You can execute the `AUDIT` and `NOAUDIT` statements to set audit rules.

For more information about the audit rules, see [AUDIT](../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/200.audit-of-oracle-mode.md).

For example, audit the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations on table `tbl1` of `user1`.

```shell
obclient> AUDIT INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE ON user1.tbl1;
```

## View audit rules

After you set the audit rules, you can view them by using a series of data dictionary views that are compatible with Oracle.

| Dictionary view | Description |
|-----------|--------|
| [ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/1000.all_def_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records default audit rules of new objects. Valid values of each column are as follows:<ul><li>  <code>-/-</code>: No auditing is performed by default. </li><li> <code>A/-</code>: Auditing is performed when the statement is executed. </li><li> <code>-/A</code>: Auditing is performed when the statement fails to be executed. </li><li> <code>A/A</code>: Auditing is performed regardless of whether the statement is executed. </li></ul> |
| [DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/20000.dba_stmt_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | The `DBA_STMT_AUDIT_OPTS` view displays audit configuration details at the statement level.  |
| [DBA_OBJ_AUDIT_OPTS](../../../700.reference/700.system-views/500.system-view-of-oracle-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-oracle-mode/16900.dba_obj_audit_opts-of-oracle-mode.md) | Records detailed auditing configuration at the object level.  |


Execute the following statement to view the audit rules in the `ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS` view:

```shell
obclient> SELECT * FROM SYS.ALL_DEF_AUDIT_OPTS;
```
