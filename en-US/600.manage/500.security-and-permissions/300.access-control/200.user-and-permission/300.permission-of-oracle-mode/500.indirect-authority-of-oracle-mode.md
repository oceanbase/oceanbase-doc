# Grant indirect privileges

User privileges are classified into direct and indirect privileges. Direct privileges are the system or object privileges that are granted to a user. Indirect privileges are those that are granted to roles of a user. Most operations can be performed with direct or indirect privileges. This topic describes how to grant indirect privileges to users.

Direct privileges are required for the following scenarios:

* When creating a view, the privileges to access the objects in the view are required.
* When executing statements in a named PL block with the definers' rights, the privileges for the statements are required.


## Indirect privileges granted to roles

### Prerequisites

You must have the privileges or roles to be added and any of the following privileges: `GRANT OPTION`, `GRANT ANY OBJECT PRIVILEGE`, `GRANT ANY PRIVILEGE`, and `GRANT ANY ROLE`.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../300.permission-of-oracle-mode/600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Grant direct privileges](200.authority-of-oracle-mode.md). For more information about how to view your roles, see [View roles](400.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/600.view-roles-of-oracle-mode.md).

### Examples

Grant the `role1` role the `SELECT` privilege on the `test1.tbl1` table.

```shell
obclient> GRANT SELECT ON test1.tbl1 TO role1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

You can also add privileges to the `PUBLIC` role by using the following SQL statement:

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>To ensure database security, grant this role only when necessary. </p>
</main>

```shell
obclient> GRANT [privilege_list] TO PUBLIC;
```

After you add a privilege to the `PUBLIC` role, all users in the tenant have the privilege. This means that all users can immediately perform operations that are authorized by the privilege. For more information about the `PUBLIC` role, see [Overview](400.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/100.roles-of-oracle-mode.md).

For more information about the `GRANT` statement, see [GRANT](../../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/1700.grant-of-oracle-mode.md).
