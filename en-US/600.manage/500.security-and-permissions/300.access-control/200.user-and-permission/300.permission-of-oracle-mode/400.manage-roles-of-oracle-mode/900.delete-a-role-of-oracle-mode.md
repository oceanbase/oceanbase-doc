# Drop a role

You can drop custom roles but not default roles. You can use the `DROP ROLE` statement to drop a role that you no longer need.

## Prerequisites

You have the `DROP ANY ROLE` system privilege and the `WITH ADMIN OPTION` privilege on the role to be dropped.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Grant direct privileges](../200.authority-of-oracle-mode.md).


## Considerations

When you drop a role, the system revokes the role from all users and roles and then drops the role from the database.

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>Dropping a role does not affect user sessions in which the role is enabled. However, after the role is dropped, the role can no longer be enabled in new user sessions. </p>
</main>

## Syntax and examples

The SQL syntax is as follows:

```sql
obclient> DROP ROLE role_name;
```

Here is an example:

```sql
obclient> DROP ROLE role1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

For more information about the `DROP ROLE` statement, see [DROP ROLE](../../../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/100.ddl-of-oracle-mode/3600.drop-role-of-oracle-mode.md).
