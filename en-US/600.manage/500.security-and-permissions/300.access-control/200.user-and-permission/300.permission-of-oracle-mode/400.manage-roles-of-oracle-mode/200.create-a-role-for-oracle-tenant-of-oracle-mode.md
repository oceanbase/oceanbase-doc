# Create a role

You can execute the `CREATE ROLE` statement to create roles and grant privileges to these roles for role-based privilege management.

## Prerequisites

You have the `CREATE ROLE` system privilege. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the `CREATE ROLE` privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Grant direct privileges](../200.authority-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax and examples

The SQL syntax is as follows:

```sql
CREATE ROLE role_name
[ NOT IDENTIFIED
| IDENTIFIED BY password
] ;
```

where:

* If the `NOT IDENTIFIED` clause is specified, a new role is not verified when it is enabled.

* `IDENTIFIED BY password` specifies the password to enable a role. If you specify this clause and grant the role to a user, the user must specify the password in the `SET ROLE` statement to enable the role.

* If you do not specify the `NOT IDENTIFIED` or `IDENTIFIED BY password` clause, the `NOT IDENTIFIED` clause is used for a new role by default.

Here is an example:

* Create a role named `role1`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE ROLE role1;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

* Create a role named `role2` and set its password to `******`.

   ```sql
   obclient> CREATE ROLE role2 IDENTIFIED BY ******;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
