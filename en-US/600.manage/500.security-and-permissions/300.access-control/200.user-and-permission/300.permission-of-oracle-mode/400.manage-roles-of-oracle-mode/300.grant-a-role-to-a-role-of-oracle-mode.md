# Grant a role to another role

After you create a role, you can grant the role to another role.

You can grant a role to any role other than itself. Circular role grant is not supported.

## Prerequisites

To grant a role to another role, you must have the role to be granted, and the `ADMIN OPTION` or `GRANT ANY ROLE` privilege.

For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../600.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Grant direct privileges](../200.authority-of-oracle-mode.md). For more information about how to view your roles, see [View roles](../400.manage-roles-of-oracle-mode/600.view-roles-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Syntax and examples

The SQL syntax is as follows:

```sql
GRANT role_name1 TO role_name2 [WITH ADMID OPTION];
```

where:

* `role_name1` specifies the name of the role to be granted to another role. When you grant multiple roles to a role at a time, separate role names with commas (,).

   You can grant a role to multiple roles at a time, or grant multiple roles to one or more roles at a time.

* `WITH ADMIN OPTION` specifies that the granted role can be granted to other users, and and revoking the role does not automatically revoke the granted role from other roles.

For example, grant the `role2` role to the `role1` role:

```sql
obclient> GRANT role2 TO role1;
Query OK, 0 rows affected
```

For more information about the `GRANT` statement, see [GRANT](../../../../../../700.reference/500.sql-reference/100.sql-syntax/300.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/900.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/300.dcl-of-oracle-mode/1700.grant-of-oracle-mode.md).
