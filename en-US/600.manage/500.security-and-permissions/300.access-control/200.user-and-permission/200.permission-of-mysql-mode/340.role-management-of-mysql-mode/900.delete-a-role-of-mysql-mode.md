# Drop a role

This topic describes how to drop a role that you no longer need by using the `DROP ROLE` statement.

## Prerequisites

You have the `CREATE USER` privilege. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Grant direct privileges](../200.authority-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Notice

When you drop a role, the system automatically revokes the role from all users and roles that are granted the role and deletes it from the database.

## Examples

* Drop the role named `role1`.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> DROP ROLE role1;
   ```

* Drop the `role1` and `role2` roles.

   ```sql
   obclient [oceanbase]> DROP ROLE role1,role2;
   ```
