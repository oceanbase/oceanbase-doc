# Grant privileges to a role

This topic describes how to grant privileges to a role after the role is created, so that users granted the role can use the privileges of the role.

## Prerequisites

You have the privileges to be granted and the `GRANT OPTION` privilege. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md). If you do not have the required privilege, contact the administrator to obtain the privilege. For more information about how to grant privileges to a user, see [Grant direct privileges](../200.authority-of-mysql-mode.md).

## Examples

* Grant the `role1` role the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO role1;
   ```

* Grant the `role1` role the `SELECT` privilege on all objects in the `dbtest` database.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT SELECT ON dbtest.* TO role1;
   ```

   Grant multiple privileges to multiple roles at a time.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT SELECT,UPDATE ON dbtest.* TO role1,role2;
   ```

* Grant the `role1` role the `SELECT` privilege on the `test1.tbl1` table.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT SELECT ON test1.tbl1 TO role1;
   ```

* Grant the `role1` role the `SELECT` privilege on the `c1` column of the `test1.tbl1` table.

   ```shell
   obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT SELECT(c1) ON test1.tbl1 TO role1;
   ```
