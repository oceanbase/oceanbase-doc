# Overview

OceanBase Database supports role management in MySQL mode.

In MySQL mode, a role is a set of privileges. You can use roles to manage user privileges.

Roles have the following characteristics:

* Like regular users, roles can be granted privileges.

* Roles can be granted other roles, that is, roles can include other roles.

* A user can be granted multiple roles, and a role can also be granted to multiple users.

Currently, OceanBase Database does not provide built-in system roles in MySQL mode by default.
