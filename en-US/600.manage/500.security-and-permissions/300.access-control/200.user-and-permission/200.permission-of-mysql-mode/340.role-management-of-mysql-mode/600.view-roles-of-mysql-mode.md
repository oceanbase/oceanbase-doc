# View roles

This topic describes how to view the activated roles of a user, roles granted to a role, and privileges of a role.

## View the roles and privileges granted to a user

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>A user can always use privileges that are directly granted, but can only use indirect privileges of an active role in a session. </p>
</main>

Use the following statement to view the roles and privileges granted to a user named `test1`:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR test1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for test1@%                              |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'test1'                   |
| GRANT `employee`@`%`,`role1`@`%` TO `test1`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set
```

If you want to view the privileges of a role granted to the `test1` user, use a `USING` clause.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR test1 USING role1;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for test1@%                              |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'test1'            |
| GRANT UPDATE, SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'test1'   |
| GRANT `employee`@`%`,`role1`@`%` TO `test1`@`%` |
+-------------------------------------------------+
3 rows in set
```

## View the roles and privileges granted to a role

Use the following statement to view the roles and privileges granted to a role named `role1`:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR role1;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for role1@%                                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'role1'                  |
| GRANT SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'role1'                 |
| GRANT SELECT ON `test1`.`tbl1` TO 'role1'             |
| GRANT `employee`@`%` TO `role1`@`%` WITH ADMIN OPTION |
+-------------------------------------------------------+
4 rows in set
```

## View the roles that become active by default when a user logs on

If you have specified to activate all roles granted to a user when the user logs on by using the global variable `activate_all_roles_on_login`, or have specified the roles that become active by default when the user logs on by using the `SET DEFAULT ROLE` or `ALTER USER` statement, you can query the `mysql.default_roles` view to check whether the settings are as expected.

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM mysql.default_roles;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
| HOST | USER  | DEFAULT_ROLE_HOST | DEFAULT_ROLE_USER |
+------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
| %    | test1 | %                 | role1             |
| %    | test1 | %                 | employee          |
+------+-------+-------------------+-------------------+
2 rows in set
```

For more information about the fields in the `mysql.default_roles` view, see [mysql.default_roles](../../../../../../700.reference/700.system-views/400.system-view-of-mysql-mode/200.dictionary-view-of-mysql-mode/3250.mysql-default_roles-of-mysql-mode.md).

## View the active roles in the current session

After you log on as a user, you can view your active roles in the current session by using the following statement:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT current_role();
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+--------------------------------+
| current_role()                 |
+--------------------------------+
| `developer`@`%`,`employee`@`%` |
+--------------------------------+
1 row in set
```

If the query result is `NONE`, none of your roles are active. You can use only the privileges of an active role.

## View authorization relationships between roles and users

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SELECT * FROM mysql.role_edges;
```

The query result is as follows:

```shell
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
| FROM_HOST | FROM_USER | TO_HOST | TO_USER | WITH_ADMIN_OPTION |
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
| %         | employee  | %       | test2   | Y                 |
| %         | employee  | %       | role1   | Y                 |
| %         | developer | %       | test1   | N                 |
+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-------------------+
3 rows in set
```

The query result is described as follows:

* The first row indicates that all privileges of the `employee` role are granted to the `test2` user, who is allowed to grant the `employee` role to other users or roles.

* The second row indicates that all privileges of the `employee` role are granted to the `role1` role, who is allowed to grant the `employee` role to other users or roles.

* The third row indicates that all privileges of the `developer` role are granted to the `test1` user, who cannot grant the `developer` role to other users or roles.
