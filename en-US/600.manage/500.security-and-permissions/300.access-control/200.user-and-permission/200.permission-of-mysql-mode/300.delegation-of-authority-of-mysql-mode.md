# Privilege delegation

Privilege delegation addresses the challenge of centralized authorization. By specifying `with admin option` or `with grant option` during the granting process, grantors allow users to delegate those same privileges to other users. Importantly, if a user's object or system privileges are revoked, any privileges they've delegated remain unchanged, preventing a cascading revocation.

## Examples

* Scenario: Privilege delegation fails

   1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of a cluster as the root user. 

   2. Create user A, and grant privileges to this user without using the `with grant option` clause.

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO A IDENTIFIED BY '******';
      Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.034 sec)
      ```

   3. Log on to the cluster as user A, create user B, and grant user B the same privileges as user A. However, an error is returned. 

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'B' IDENTIFIED BY '******';
      ERROR 1227 (42501): Access denied; you need (at least one of) the GRANT privilege(s) for this operation
      ```

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
         <h4>Notice</h4>
         <p>If you grant a privilege to a user without using the <code>WITH GRANT OPTION</code> clause, the user cannot grant the same privilege to other users.</p>
      </main>

* Scenario: Successful privilege delegation
  
   1. Log on to a MySQL tenant of a cluster as the root user. 

   2. Grant privileges to user A using the `with grant option` clause. 

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO A with grant option;
      ```

   3. Log on to the cluster as user A, create user B, and grant user B the same privileges as user A.
   
      A success message is returned. 

      ```shell
      obclient> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'B' IDENTIFIED BY '******';
      Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.058 sec)
      ```
