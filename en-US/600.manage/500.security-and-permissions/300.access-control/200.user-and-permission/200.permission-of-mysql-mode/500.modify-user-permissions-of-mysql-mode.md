# Revoke privileges

This topic describes how to revoke privileges from a user.

## Prerequisites

* You must have the privileges to be revoked and the `GRANT OPTION` privilege. For example, if the `test1` user wants to revoke the `SELECT` privilege on the `t1` table from the `test2` user, the `test1` user must have the `SELECT` privilege on the `t1` table.

* To revoke the `ALL PRIVILEGES` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges, you must have the global `GRANT OPTION` privilege or the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` privileges on the table.

## Considerations

* When you revoke multiple privileges from a user at a time, separate the privileges with commas (,).

* When you revoke a privilege from multiple users at a time, separate the usernames with commas (,).

* The revocation does not cascade to dependent users. For example, if the `test1` user has granted some privileges to the `test2` user, when the privileges of the `test1` user are revoked, the privileges granted to the `test2` user will not be revoked.

## Examples

* Revoke global privileges

   To revoke the `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on all tables in all databases from the `test` user, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient> REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON *.* FROM 'test';
   ```

* Revoke database-level privileges

   To revoke the `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on all tables in the `db1` database from the `test` user, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient> REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON db1 FROM 'test';
   ```

* Revoke table-level privileges

   To revoke the `INSERT` and `SELECT` privileges on the `tb1_name` table in the `db1` database from the `test` user, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient> REVOKE SELECT, INSERT ON db1.tb1_name FROM 'test';
   ```

* Revoke column-level privileges

   To revoke the `SELECT` privilege on the `c1` column and the `INSERT` privilege on the `c1` and `c2` columns of the `tb1_name` table in the `db1` database from the `test` user, execute the following statement:

   ```shell
   obclient> REVOKE SELECT(c1), INSERT (c1, c2) ON db1.tb1_name FROM test;
   ```
