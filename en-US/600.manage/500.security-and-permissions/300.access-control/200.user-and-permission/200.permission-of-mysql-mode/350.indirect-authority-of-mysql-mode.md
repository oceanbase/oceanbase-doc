# Grant indirect privileges

User privileges are divided into direct and indirect privileges. Direct privileges are directly granted to a user. Indirect privileges are granted to the roles of a user. Most operations can be performed with direct or indirect privileges.

## Obtain the privileges granted to roles

If you grant a role to a user or another role of the user, the user indirectly obtains the privileges of the granted role.

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>A user can always use privileges that are directly granted, but can only use indirect privileges of an active role in a session. For more information about how to activate a role, see <a href="340.role-management-of-mysql-mode/500.activating-roles-of-mysql-mode.md">Activate a role</a>. </p>
</main>

### Prerequisites

You have the roles to be granted and the `ADMIN OPTION` privilege. For more information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../200.permission-of-mysql-mode/400.view-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).

### Background information

Assume that a user named `test1` has been granted the `employee` role. You can execute the following statement to view the privileges granted to the `employee` role:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR employee;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for employee@%                            |
+--------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'employee'          |
| GRANT UPDATE, SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'employee' |
+--------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set
```

Assume that you have the `developer` role. You can execute the following statement to view the privileges of the `developer` role:

```shell
obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR developer;
```

The result is as follows:

```shell
+------------------------------------------+
| Grants for developer@%                   |
+------------------------------------------+
| GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'developer' |
+------------------------------------------+
1 row in set
```

### Examples

If you want to grant all operation privileges of the `developer` role to the `test1` user, perform the following steps:

* Grant the required role to the user

   1. Grant the `developer` role to the `test1` user.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT developer TO test1;
      ```

      If you want to use the `test1` user to grant the role to another user, add the `WITH ADMIN OPTION` clause.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT developer TO test1 WITH ADMIN OPTION;
      ```

   2. Use the `SHOW GRANTS ... USING` statement to view the privileges obtained by the `test1` user from the `developer` role.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR test1 USING developer;
      ```

      The result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------------------------------------------------+
      | Grants for test1@%                                  |
      +-----------------------------------------------------+
      | GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'test1'                |
      | GRANT `developer`@`%`,`employee`@`%` TO `test1`@`%` |
      +-----------------------------------------------------+
      2 rows in set
      ```

* Grant the required role to another role

   1. Grant the `developer` role to the `employee` role.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> GRANT developer TO employee;
      ```

   2. Use the `SHOW GRANTS ... USING` statement to view the privileges obtained by the `test1` user from the `employee` role.

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR test1 USING employee;
      ```

      The result is as follows:

      ```shell
      +-----------------------------------------------+
      | Grants for test1@%                            |
      +-----------------------------------------------+
      | GRANT ALTER SYSTEM ON *.* TO 'test1'          |
      | GRANT UPDATE, SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'test1' |
      | GRANT `employee`@`%` TO `test1`@`%`           |
      +-----------------------------------------------+
      3 rows in set
      ```

      The result indicates that the `test1` user obtained the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege from the `employee` role. Then, execute the following statement to view the roles or privileges granted to the `employee` role:

      ```shell
      obclient [oceanbase]> SHOW GRANTS FOR employee;
      ```

      The result is as follows and it indicates that the `ALTER SYSTEM` privilege is granted from the `developer` role.

      ```shell
      +--------------------------------------------------+
      | Grants for employee@%                            |
      +--------------------------------------------------+
      | GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'employee'                 |
      | GRANT UPDATE, SELECT ON `dbtest`.* TO 'employee' |

      +--------------------------------------------------+
      2 rows in set
      ```
