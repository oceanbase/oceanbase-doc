# Privilege types in MySQL mode

This topic describes the privilege types supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.

## Privilege types

The MySQL mode of OceanBase Database supports the following three levels of privileges:

* Global privileges: the privileges to manage a tenant, such as modifying system settings and accessing all tables in the tenant.
* Database privileges: the privileges to manage all objects in a database, such as creating or deleting tables in the database, and accessing those tables.
* Object privileges: the privileges to manage a specific object, such as accessing a specific table, view, or index.

The following table lists the privileges supported by the MySQL mode of OceanBase Database.
