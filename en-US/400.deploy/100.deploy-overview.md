# Overview

OceanBase Database is available in two editions: OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition and OceanBase Database Community Edition.

* OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-level, native distributed database independently developed by the OceanBase team. It provides financial-grade high availability on commodity hardware. Its groundbreaking deployment mode of "five IDCs across three regions" sets a new standard for automatic, lossless disaster recovery at the region level. OceanBase Database has also set new records in the TPC-C benchmark test, supporting more than 1,500 nodes in one cluster. It is cloud-native, highly consistent, and highly compatible with Oracle and MySQL.

* OceanBase Database Community Edition is a standalone distributed and integrated database compatible with MySQL. It is built on the native distributed architecture and supports enterprise-level features such as financial-grade high availability, transparent horizontal scaling, distributed transactions, multitenancy, and syntax compatibility. OceanBase Database Community Edition has an open-source kernel and provides open APIs and various eco-capabilities to meet the business requirements of enterprises or individuals.

This topic describes the deployment methods and scenarios of the two editions of OceanBase Database.

## Deployment methods

**OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition**

* Use OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) to deploy an OceanBase cluster
* Use OceanBase Deployer (obd) to deploy an OceanBase cluster
* Use the CLI to deploy an OceanBase cluster

**OceanBase Database Community Edition**

* Use obd to deploy an OceanBase cluster
* Use OCP to deploy an OceanBase cluster
* Use the Docker image to deploy an OceanBase cluster
* Use ob-operator to deploy an OceanBase cluster in a Kubernetes environment

## Deployment scenarios

**OceanBase Database Enterprise Edition**

* For a production environment, we recommend that you deploy an OceanBase cluster by using OCP. For more information, see [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using OCP](300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/300.deploy-through-a-graphical-interface/300.deploy-oceanbase-cluster-use-ocp/500.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters-use-ocp.md).

* For a non-production environment, you can use the CLI to deploy an OceanBase cluster. For more information, see [Deploy a three-replica OceanBase cluster by using the CLI](300.deploy-oceanbase-enterprise-edition/400.deploy-through-the-command-line/200.deploy-the-oceanbase-cluster-command-line/400.deploy-three-oceanbase-replica-clusters.md).

* For quick starts in a non-production environment, you can use obd to deploy an OceanBase cluster. For more information, see **Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment** or **Solution 2: Deploy an OceanBase cluster** in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

**OceanBase Database Community Edition**

* If you want to get started quickly with OceanBase Database in a non-natively supported operating system such as macOS and Windows, we recommend that you deploy OceanBase Database by using the Docker image. For more information, see **Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container** in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

* If you want to get started quickly with OceanBase Database in a natively supported operating system such as Linux, we recommend that you deploy OceanBase Database by using obd. For more information, see **Solution 1: Deploy OceanBase Database in a demo environment** or **Solution 2: Deploy an OceanBase cluster** in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

* In an online environment, we recommend that you use obd for standard deployment. For more information, see [Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI of obd](500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/200.local-deployment/400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md).

* In a Kubernetes environment, we recommend that you use ob-operator for deployment. For more information, see [Deploy an OceanBase cluster in a Kubernetes environment](500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/300.deploy-in-the-k8s-cluster.md).
