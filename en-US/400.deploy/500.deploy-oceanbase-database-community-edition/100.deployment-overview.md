# Overview

You can deploy OceanBase Database Community Edition in the following ways:

* Quick deployment: If you want to deploy a standalone instance of OceanBase Database Community Edition for quick start, refer to the quick deployment section.

## Quick deployment

* For non-natively supported operating systems such as macOS and Windows, we recommend that you deploy the database by using a Docker image. For more information, see **Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container** in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

* For natively supported operating systems such as Linux, we recommend that you deploy the database by using OceanBase Deployer (obd). For more information, see **Solution 1** and **Solution 2** in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

## Standard deployment

* In an online environment, we recommend that you use obd for standard deployment. For more information, see [Deploy an OceanBase cluster through the GUI of obd](200.local-deployment/400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md).

* In a Kubernetes environment, we recommend that you use ob-operator for deployment. For more information, see [Deploy an OceanBase cluster in a Kubernetes environment](../500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/300.deploy-in-the-k8s-cluster.md).
