# Overview

You can deploy OceanBase Database Community Edition in the following ways:

* Quick deployment: If you want to deploy a standalone instance of OceanBase Database Community Edition for quick start, refer to the quick deployment section.

<!-- * Deployment for online experience: If you want to experience OceanBase Database Community Edition online without deploying it, refer to the online experience section. -->

## Quick deployment

* For non-natively supported operating systems such as macOS and Windows, we recommend that you deploy the database by using a Docker image. For more information, see "Solution 3: Deploy OceanBase Database in a container" in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

* For natively supported operating systems such as Linux, we recommend that you deploy the database by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD) with a few clicks. For more information, see "Solution 1" and "Solution 2" in [Get started with OceanBase Database](../../200.quickstart/100.quickly-experience-oceanbase-for-community.md).

## Standard deployment

* In an offline environment, we recommend that you use OBD for standard deployment.

* In a Kubernetes environment, we recommend that you use ob-operator for deployment. For more information, see [Deploy OceanBase Database in a Kubernetes cluster](../500.deploy-oceanbase-database-community-edition/300.deploy-in-the-k8s-cluster.md).
