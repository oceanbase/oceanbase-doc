# Deploy OceanBase Database in a production environment by using the CLI

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Database in a production environment by running OceanBase Deployer (obd) commands on the CLI.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You can also deploy an OceanBase cluster through the GUI of obd. We recommend that you choose this GUI-based deployment method. For more information, see <a href="400.deploy-by-ui/100.deploy-by-obd.md">Deploy an OceanBase cluster through the GUI of obd</a>. </p>
</main>

## Terms

* Central control server

   The server on which obd is installed. It stores the installation package and configuration information about OceanBase clusters and is used for cluster management.

* Target server

   The server where you want to install OceanBase Database.

* obd

   obd is a tool used to install and deploy OceanBase Database. For more information, see [obd Documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-en).

* ODP

   OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), also known as OBProxy, is a dedicated proxy service designed for OceanBase Database. For more information, see [ODP Documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-odp-en-10000000001007322).

   OCP Express is a web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x. Integrated with an OceanBase cluster, OCP Express allows you to view key performance metrics of the cluster and perform basic database management operations on the cluster. For more information, see [OCP Express](../../../700.reference/1400.platform-products/400.1.ocp-express/100.ocp-express.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you deploy OceanBase Database, make sure that the following requirements are met:

* Your server meets the software and hardware requirements. For more information, see [Software and hardware requirements](../200.local-deployment/100.requirements-for-software-and-hardware.md).

* In the production environment, you must check the environment and configurations. For more information, see [Configuration before deployment](200.environment-and-configuration-checks/100.view-resources-optional.md).

* You have installed obd (latest version recommended) on the central control server. For more information, see [Install and configure obd](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000001022740).

* You have installed OceanBase Client (OBClient) on your server. For more information, see [OBClient Documentation](https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient/blob/master/README.md).

## Deployment mode

This topic describes a three-replica deployment mode. You can choose an appropriate deployment mode as needed. We recommend that you use four servers for this deployment mode. The following table describes how the four servers are used.

| Role | Server | Remarks |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| obd | 10.10.10.4 | The automatic deployment software installed on the central control server. |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.1 | OceanBase Database Zone1 |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.2 | OceanBase Database Zone2 |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.3 | OceanBase Database Zone3 |
| OBAgent | 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, and 10.10.10.3 | A data monitoring and collection framework for OceanBase Database. |
| ODP | 10.10.10.4 | A reverse proxy designed for OceanBase Database. |
| OCP Express | 10.10.10.4 | A web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x. |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>In the production environment, we recommend that you deploy your applications on the same servers as ODP to minimize the latency of access from ODP to the applications. That is, you can deploy an ODP service on each application server. In this example, ODP is separately deployed for ease of illustration. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Configurations of the ODP server can be different from those of servers for the deployment of OceanBase Database. The server where ODP is to be deployed requires at least one CPU core and 1 GB of memory. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>For more information about how to deploy a standalone database, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000001022726">Deploy OceanBase Database on a single OBServer node</a> in obd Documentation. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</main>

## Procedure

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>The following describes the deployment of OceanBase Database on an x86-based CentOS Linux 7.9 platform. The procedure may be different on other OS platforms. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Before you deploy the OceanBase cluster, we recommend that you switch to a non-root user for data security. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</main>

### Step 1: (Optional) Download and install the all-in-one package

OceanBase provides an all-in-one installation package since V4.0.0. You can use this package to install obd, OceanBase Database, ODP, OBAgent, and other components at a time.

You can download and install desired components of specified versions from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).

#### Online installation

If your server can connect to the Internet, run the following commands to install the components online:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ bash -c "$(curl -s https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/download-center/opensource/oceanbase-all-in-one/installer.sh)"
[admin@test001 ~]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
```

#### Offline installation

If your server cannot connect to the Internet, perform the following steps to install the components offline:

1. Download the latest all-in-one package from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) and copy it to any directory on the central control server.

2. In the directory where the package is located, run the following commands to decompress and install the package:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ tar -xzf oceanbase-all-in-one-*.tar.gz
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./install.sh
   [admin@test001 bin]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You can run the <code>which obd</code> and <code>which obclient</code> commands to check whether the installation is successful. If you can find the obd and obclient paths in the <code>.oceanbase-all-in-one</code> directory, the installation is successful. </p>
</main>

### Step 2: Configure obd

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This topic uses obd V2.8.0 as an example. The configuration file may vary with the obd version. For more information about obd, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-en">obd Documentation</a>. </p>
</main>

If you are deploying an OceanBase cluster offline, you can download the all-in-one installation package to the central control server and install the package as described in **Step 1**. The components provided in the all-in-one installation package have been adapted to each other and are officially recommended.

You can also download the installation package of the desired version for a component from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter). Then, copy the package to any directory on the central control server and perform the following steps to configure obd.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If you are deploying the OceanBase cluster online or by using the all-in-one installation package, skip the following steps 1 to 3. </p>
</main>

1. Disable remote repositories.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror disable remote
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>After you install the all-in-one package, the remote repositories are automatically disabled. You can run the <code>obd mirror list</code> command for confirmation. If the values of the remote repositories in the <code>Enabled</code> column are changed to <code>False</code>, the remote image sources are disabled. </p>
   </main>

2. Add the installation package to the local image repository.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror clone *.rpm
   ```

3. View the list of installation packages in the local image repository.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror list local
   ```

4. Select a configuration file.

   If obd is directly downloaded and installed on your server, you can view the sample configuration file provided by obd in the `/usr/obd/example` directory.

   If obd is installed by using the all-in-one package, you can view the sample configuration file provided by obd in the `~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/conf` directory. Select the corresponding configuration file based on your resource conditions.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>Two types of configuration files are available: one for the small-scale development mode and one for the professional development mode. The configuration files for the two modes contain the same parameters but different parameter values. You can select a file based on your resource conditions. </p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>The small-scale development mode applies to individual devices with at least 8 GB of memory. The configuration file name contains <code>mini</code> or <code>min</code>. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>The professional development mode applies to advanced Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances or physical servers with at least 16 CPU cores and 64 GB of memory. </p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

   If you select standalone deployment, only one target server is required. In this case, you can use a configuration file for standalone deployment.

   * Sample configuration files for local standalone deployment: `mini-local-example.yaml` and `local-example.yaml`

   * Sample configuration files for standalone deployment: `mini-single-example.yaml` and `single-example.yaml`

   * Sample configuration files for standalone deployment with ODP: `mini-single-with-obproxy-example.yaml` and `single-with-obproxy-example.yaml`

   If you select distributed deployment, multiple target servers are required. In this case, you can use a configuration file for distributed deployment.

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment: `mini-distributed-example.yaml` and `distributed-example.yaml`

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with ODP: `mini-distributed-with-obproxy-example.yaml` and `distributed-with-obproxy-example.yaml`

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with ODP and OCP Express: `default-components.yaml` and `default-components-min.yaml`

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with all components: `all-components-min.yaml` and `all-components.yaml`

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If you choose to deploy OCP Express or have deployed OCP, you do not need to deploy Prometheus or Grafana. </p>
   </main>

5. Modify the configuration file.

   The following uses `default-components.yaml`, a configuration file for distributed deployment, as an example to describe how to modify the configuration file.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You need to modify related parameters based on the actual environment. </p>
   </main>

   1. Change the username and password.

      ```yaml
      ## Only need to configure when remote login is required
      user:
        username: admin
      #   password: your password if need
        key_file: /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa
      #   port: your ssh port, default 22
      #   timeout: ssh connection timeout (second), default 30
      ```

      Here, `username` specifies the username of the account used to log on to the target server. Make sure that this account has the write privilege on `home_path`. `password` and `key_file` are used for user verification. Generally, you only need to specify either of them.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>After you specify the path of the key, comment out or delete the <code>password</code> field if your key does not require a password. Otherwise, the value of the <code>password</code> parameter will be taken as the password of the key and used for logon, leading to a logon verification failure. </p>
      </main>

   2. Modify the IP address, port, and related directories of each server, and specify memory-related parameters and the password.

      ```yaml
      oceanbase-ce:
        servers:
          # Please don't use hostname, only IP can be supported
          - name: server1
            ip: 10.10.10.1
          - name: server2
            ip: 10.10.10.2
          - name: server3
            ip: 10.10.10.3
        global:
          devname: eth0
          cluster_id: 1
          # please set memory limit to a suitable value which is matching resource.
          memory_limit: 64G # The maximum running memory for an observer
          system_memory: 30G # The reserved system memory. system_memory is reserved for general tenants.
          datafile_size: 192G # Size of the data file.
          datafile_next: 200G
          datafile_maxsize: 1T
          log_disk_size: 192G # The size of disk space used by the clog files.
          enable_syslog_wf: false # Print system logs whose levels are higher than WARNING to a separate log file. The default value is true.
          max_syslog_file_count: 4 # The maximum number of reserved log files before enabling auto recycling. The default value is 0.
          # observer cluster name, consistent with obproxy's cluster_name
          appname: obdemo
          ocp_meta_tenant: # The config for ocp express meta tenant
            tenant_name: ocp
            max_cpu: 1
            memory_size: 2G
            log_disk_size: 7680M
          mysql_port: 2881 # External port for OceanBase Database. The default value is 2881. DO NOT change this value after the cluster is started.
          rpc_port: 2882 # Internal port for OceanBase Database. The default value is 2882. DO NOT change this value after the cluster is started.
          obshell_port: 2886 # Operation and maintenance port for OceanBase Database.
          # The working directory for OceanBase Database. OceanBase Database is started under this directory. This is a required field.
          home_path: /home/admin/observer
          # The directory for data storage. The default value is $home_path/store.
          data_dir: /data
          # The directory for clog, ilog, and slog. The default value is the same as the data_dir value.
          redo_dir: /redo
          root_password: ****** # root user password, can be empty
          proxyro_password: ******** # proxyro user pasword, consistent with obproxy's observer_sys_password, can be empty
        server1:
          zone: zone1
        server2:
          zone: zone2
        server3:
          zone: zone3
      ```

      If the servers have inconsistent parameters, move the relevant parameters to the sections of target servers and separately set the parameters for the servers. Parameters in server sections have higher priority than those in the `global` section. For example, you can modify the configuration file as follows to configure different ports for two servers:

      ```yaml
      server2:
        mysql_port: 3881
        rpc_port: 3882
        zone: zone2
      server3:
        mysql_port: 2881
        rpc_port: 2882
        zone: zone3
      ```

Set this password to the same value as `proxyro_password`. If you do not specify this parameter in obd V2.1.0 or later, a random string same as `proxyro_password` is automatically generated.  |

   4. Modify the IP addresses and `home_path` for the obagent and ocp-express components.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>obd V2.0.0 and later support the deployment of OCP Express. obd V2.0.0 supports the deployment of OCP Express V1.0.0 only. To deploy OCP Express V1.0.1 or later, you must use obd V2.1.0 or later. </p>
      </main>

      ```yaml
      obagent:
        depends:
          - oceanbase-ce
        servers:

          home_path: /home/oceanbase/ocp-server
          memory_size: 1G # The memory size of ocp-express server. The recommend value is 512MB * (expect node num + expect tenant num) * 60MB.
          admin_passwd: ********

      | Parameter | Required | Default value | Description |
      |----------|-----------|----------|----------|
      | servers | Yes | N/A | Specify each server in the format of `- name: server identifier (line feed) ip: server IP address`. You can specify multiple servers. The server identifiers must be unique. </br>If the server IP addresses are unique, you can also specify the servers in the `- <ip> (line break)- <ip>` format. In this case, `- <ip>` is equivalent to `- name: server IP address (line break) ip: server IP address`.  |
      | home_path | Yes | N/A | The installation path of the component. We recommend that you use a path under the admin user.  |
      | memory_size | Yes | N/A | The memory capacity of the OCP Express server. The recommended value is calculated as follows: memory_size = 512 MB + (Expected number of nodes × Expected number of tenants) × 60 MB. The sys tenant and OCP meta tenant must be included in this formula.  |
      | logging_file_total_size_cap | Yes | 1 GB | The total size of log files. The default value is 1 GB. <main id="notice" type='notice'><h4>Notice</h4><p>The unit of this parameter must be GB or MB. If you use the unit G or M, an error is reported and OCP Express cannot be deployed. </p></main> |
      | admin_passwd | Yes | N/A | The password of the admin account for logging on to OCP Express. The password must be 8~32 characters in length and contain at least two digits, two uppercase letters, two lowercase letters, and two special characters. The supported special characters are <code>~ ! @ # % ^ & * _ - + = \| ( ) { } [ ] : ; , . ? /</code>. If you do not specify this parameter in obd V2.1.0 or later, a random string is automatically generated.  |

### Step 3: Deploy the OceanBase cluster

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>For more information about the commands used in this section, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000001082230">Cluster commands</a> in obd Documentation. </p>
</main>

1. Deploy an OceanBase cluster.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster deploy obtest -c default-components.yaml
   ```

   After you run the `obd cluster deploy` command, if your server is connected to the Internet, obd checks whether the desired installation package exists on the target server. If no, obd automatically obtains the installation package from the YUM source.

2. Start the OceanBase cluster.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster start obtest
   ```

   If OCP Express is installed, the access address of OCP Express is returned. On Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the installation program may fail to obtain a public IP address and thereby return an intranet network address. Make sure that you use the correct address.

3. View the status of the OceanBase cluster.

   ```shell
   # View the list of clusters managed by obd.
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster list

   # View the status of the obtest cluster.
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster display obtest
   ```

4. (Optional) Modify the cluster configurations.

   OceanBase Database has hundreds of parameters and some are coupled. We recommend that you do not modify parameters in the sample configuration file before you become familiar with OceanBase Database. The following example shows you how to modify a parameter and make it take effect:

   Run the `obd cluster edit-config` command to enter the edit mode before you can edit the cluster configurations.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster edit-config obtest
   ```

   After you modify and save the configurations and exit, obd will prompt you on how to validate the modifications. The output after saving the configurations is as follows:

   ```shell
   Search param plugin and load ok
   Search param plugin and load ok
   Parameter check ok
   Save deploy "obtest" configuration
   Use `obd cluster reload obtest` to make changes take effect.
   ```

   Copy and run the command provided by obd.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster reload obtest
   ```

### Step 4: Connect to the OceanBase cluster

Here, we use OBClient as an example to describe how to connect to the OceanBase cluster:

```shell
obclient -h<IP> -P<PORT> -u<user_name>@<tenant_name>#<cluster_name> -p -c -A
# example
obclient -h10.10.10.4 -P2883 -uroot@sys#obdemo -p -c -A
```

where

* `-h` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. The value is the IP address of an OBServer node in the case of direct connection, and is the IP address of ODP in the case of connection through ODP.

* `-u` specifies the account for connecting to OceanBase Database. Supported account formats are `username@tenant name#cluster name`, `cluster name:tenant name:username`, `cluster name-tenant name-username`, and `cluster name.tenant name.username`. The default administrator username for a MySQL tenant is `root`.

  <main id="notice" type='notice'>
    <h4>Notice</h4>
    <p>The cluster name used for connection is the one specified by <code>appname</code> in the configuration file, instead of the one specified by <code>deploy name</code> during deployment. </p>
  </main>

* `-P` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. It is the value of the `mysql_port` parameter in the case of direct connection, and the value of the `listen_port` parameter in the case of connection through ODP.

* `-p` specifies the password for connecting to OceanBase Database.

* `-c` specifies not to ignore comments in the runtime environment of OBClient.

  <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Hints are special comments that are not affected by the <code>-c</code> option. </p>
  </main>

* `-A` specifies not to automatically retrieve statistics when connecting to OceanBase Database by using OBClient.

For more information about how to connect to an OceanBase cluster, see [Connect to OceanBase Database](../../../300.develop/100.application-development-of-mysql-mode/100.connect-to-oceanbase-database-of-mysql-mode/100.connection-methods-overview-of-mysql-mode.md).

### Step 5: Create a user tenant

After the OceanBase cluster is deployed, we recommend that you create a user tenant to perform business operations. The sys tenant is intended only for cluster management and is unsuitable for business scenarios.

You can use one of the following methods to create a user tenant:

* Method 1: Create a user tenant by using obd.

   ```shell
   obd cluster tenant create <deploy name> [-n <tenant name>] [flags]
   # example
   obd cluster tenant create test -n obmysql --max-cpu=2 --memory-size=2G --log-disk-size=3G --max-iops=10000 --iops-weight=2 --unit-num=1 --charset=utf8
   ```

   By default, this command creates a tenant based on all remaining available resources of the cluster. You can configure the parameters to allocate specific amount of resources to the tenant. For more information about this command, see **obd cluster tenant create** in [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000001082230).

* Method 2: Create a user tenant by using the CLI. For more information, see [Create a tenant](../../../600.manage/200.tenant-management/600.common-tenant-operations/200.manage-create-tenant.md).

### Manage clusters

You can run the following commands to manage OceanBase clusters deployed by using obd. For more information, see [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000001082230) in obd Documentation.

```shell
# View the cluster list.
obd cluster list

# View the status of a cluster. The following takes the `obtest` cluster as an example.
obd cluster display obtest

# Stop a running cluster. The following takes the `obtest` cluster as an example.
obd cluster stop obtest

# Destroy a deployed cluster. The following takes the `obtest` cluster as an example.
obd cluster destroy obtest
```

### Uninstall the all-in-one package

To uninstall the all-in-one package, perform the following steps:

1. Uninstall the package.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./uninstall.sh
   ```

2. Delete environment variables.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 bin]$ vim ~/.bash_profile
   # Delete the source /home/admin/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh from the file.
   ```

3. Make the modification take effect.

   After you delete the environment variables, you must log on to the terminal again or run the `source` command to make the modification take effect. Here is an example:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ source ~/.bash_profile
   ```
