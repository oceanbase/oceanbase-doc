# Deploy OceanBase Database in a production environment by using a CLI

This topic describes how to deploy OceanBase Database in a production environment by using OceanBase Deployer (OBD).

<!-- <main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>OBD allows you to deploy OceanBase Database in a production environment both by using a CLI and on the GUI. We recommend that you deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI of OBD. For more information, see <a href="4.deploy-by-ui/1.deploy-by-obd.md">Deploy an OceanBase cluster on the GUI of OBD</a>. </p>
</main> -->

## Concepts

* Central control server

   The server where OBD is installed. The central control server manages the OceanBase cluster and stores the installation package and configurations of the cluster.

* Target server

   The server on which you want to install OceanBase Database.

* OBD

   OBD is a tool used to install and deploy OceanBase clusters. For more information, see the [OBD documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-en).

* ODP

   OceanBase Database Proxy (ODP), also known as OBProxy, is a high-performance reverse proxy server for OceanBase Database. For more information, see the [ODP documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/odp-en).

* OCP

   OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) is an operation and maintenance tool of OceanBase Database. For more information, see the [OCP documentation](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/ocp-en).

* OCP Express

   OCP Express is a web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x. It is integrated into OceanBase clusters to provide key performance management and basic database management. For more information, see [OCP Express](../../../700.reference/600.platform-products/400.1.ocp-express.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you connect to OceanBase Database, make sure that:

* Your server meets the software and hardware requirements. For more information, see [Software and hardware requirements](../200.local-deployment/100.requirements-for-software-and-hardware.md).

* You have checked the production environment and configurations. For more information, see [Configuration before deployment](200.environment-and-configuration-checks/100.view-resources-optional.md).

* You have installed OBD of the latest version on the central control server. For more information, see [Install and configure OBD](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000862271).

* You have installed OceanBase Client (OBClient) on your server. For more information, see the [OBClient documentation](https://github.com/oceanbase/obclient/blob/master/README.md).

## Deployment mode

This topic describes a three-replica deployment mode. You can choose an appropriate deployment mode as needed. We recommend that you use four servers for this deployment mode. The following table describes the purposes of the four servers.

| Role | Server | Remarks |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------|
| OBD | 10.10.10.4 | Automatic deployment software installed on the central control server |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.1 | Zone 1 of OceanBase Database |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.2 | Zone 2 of OceanBase Database |
| OBServer node | 10.10.10.3 | Zone 3 of OceanBase Database |
| OBAgent | 10.10.10.1, 10.10.10.2, and 10.10.10.3 | Monitoring information collection framework of OceanBase Database |
| ODP | 10.10.10.4 | Reverse proxy software dedicated for OceanBase Database |
| OCP Express | 10.10.10.4 | Web-based management tool for OceanBase Database V4.x |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>In a production environment, we recommend that you deploy ODP and your applications on the same server to reduce the time required by ODP to access applications. You can deploy an ODP service on each application server. In this example, ODP is deployed on a separate server. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Configurations of the ODP server can be different from those of servers for deploying OceanBase Database. At least one CPU core and 1 GB of memory are required for deploying ODP. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>For more information about how to deploy OceanBase Database on a single OBServer node, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000862276">Deploy OceanBase Database on a single OBServer node</a>. </p>

## Procedure

<main id="notice" type='notice'>
  <h4>Notice</h4>
  <ul>
  <li>
  <p>This section describes the steps of deploying OceanBase Database on CentOS Linux 7.9 for the x86 architecture. The procedure may be different on other operating systems. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p>Before you deploy the OceanBase cluster, we recommend that you switch to a non-root user for data security. </p>
  </li>
  </ul>
</main>

### (Optional) Step 1: Download and install the all-in-one package

OceanBase Database is available in an all-in-one installation package since V4.0.0. You can use this package to install OBD, OceanBase Database, ODP, OceanBase Agent (OBAgent), Grafana, Prometheus, and OCP Express at a time.

You can download and install desired components of specified versions from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter).

#### Online installation

If your server can connect to the Internet, run the following commands to install OBD online.

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ bash -c "$(curl -s https://obbusiness-private.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/download-center/opensource/oceanbase-all-in-one/installer.sh)"
[admin@test001 ~]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
```

#### Offline installation

If your server cannot connect to the Internet, perform the following steps to install OBD offline.

1. Download the latest all-in-one package from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) and copy it to any directory on the central control server.

2. In the directory where the package is located, run the following commands to decompress and install the package:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ tar -xzf oceanbase-all-in-one-*.tar.gz
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./install.sh
   [admin@test001 bin]$ source ~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh
   ```

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You can run the <code>which obd</code> and <code>which obclient</code> commands to check whether the installation is successful. If you can find the obd and obclient directories in the <code>.oceanbase-all-in-one</code> directory, the installation is successful. </p>
</main>

### Step 2: Configure OBD

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This topic takes OBD V2.1.1 as an example. The configuration file varies based on the OBD version. For more information about OBD, see the <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/obd-en">OBD documentation</a>. </p>
</main>

If you deploy the OceanBase cluster in offline mode, download the all-in-one package and install it on the central control server by referring to **Step 1**. The components in the all-in-one package have passed mutual adaptation tests and therefore are recommended.

You can download the installation package of the desired version for a component from [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter). Then, copy the package to any directory on the central control server and perform the following steps to configure OBD.

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If you deploy the OceanBase cluster in online mode or by using the all-in-one package, skip steps 1 to 3 in the following procedure. </p>
</main>

1. Disable remote repositories.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror disable remote
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>After you install the all-in-one package, the remote repositories are automatically disabled. You can run the <code>obd mirror list</code> command for confirmation. If the values of the remote repositories in the <code>Enabled</code> column are changed to <code>False</code>, the remote image sources are disabled. </p>
   </main>

2. Add the installation package of OBD to the local image repository.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror clone *.rpm
   ```

3. View the installation packages list in the local image repository

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 rpm]$ obd mirror list local
   ```

4. Select a configuration file.

   If OBD is directly downloaded and installed on your server, you can view the sample configuration file provided by OBD in the `/usr/obd/example` directory.

   If OBD is installed by using the all-in-one package, you can view the sample configuration file provided by OBD in the `~/.oceanbase-all-in-one/obd/usr/obd/example` directory. Select the corresponding configuration file based on your resources.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <p>OBD has two configuration files for two modes: minimum specification and professional. The two configuration files have the same resource items with different values. You can select a configuration file based on your actual resource conditions. </p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>Minimum-specification mode: applies to individual servers with at least 8 GB of memory. The name of the configuration file of this mode contains the <code>mini</code> or <code>min</code> keyword. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>Professional mode: applies to an advanced Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instance or physical server with at least 16 CPU cores and 64 GB of memory. </p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

   If you deploy OceanBase Database in standalone mode (with only one OBServer node), you can use the configuration file for standalone deployment.

   * Sample configuration files for local standalone deployment: mini-local-example.yaml and local-example.yaml

   * Sample configuration files for standalone deployment: mini-single-example.yaml and single-example.yaml

   * Sample configuration files for standalone deployment with ODP: mini-single-with-obproxy-example.yaml and single-with-obproxy-example.yaml

   If you deploy OceanBase Database in distributed mode (with multiple OBServer nodes), you can use a configuration file for distributed deployment.

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment: mini-distributed-example.yaml and distributed-example.yaml

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with ODP: mini-distributed-with-obproxy-example.yaml and distributed-with-obproxy-example.yaml

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with ODP and OCP Express: default-components.yaml and default-components-min.yaml

   * Sample configuration files for distributed deployment with all components: all-components-min.yaml and all-components.yaml

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>If you want to deploy OCP Express or you have deployed OCP, you do not need to deploy Prometheus and Grafana. </p>
   </main>

5. Modify the configuration file.

   The following procedure describes how to use the configuration file default-components.yaml to deploy a distributed OceanBase cluster.

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>You must modify the related parameters based on the actual environment. </p>
   </main>

   1. Change the username and password.

      ```yaml
      ## Only need to configure when remote login is required
      user:
        username: admin
      #   password: your password if need
        key_file: /home/admin/.ssh/id_rsa
      #   port: your ssh port, default 22
      #   timeout: ssh connection timeout (second), default 30
      ```

      Here, `username` specifies the username of the account used to log on to the target server. Make sure that this account has the write privilege on `home_path`. `password` and `key_file` are used for user verification. Generally, you only need to specify either of them.

      <main id="notice" type='notice'>
        <h4>Notice</h4>
        <p>After you specify the path of the key, comment out or delete the <code>password</code> field if your key does not require a password. Otherwise, the value of the <code>password</code> parameter will be deemed as the password of the key and used for logon, leading to a logon verification failure. </p>
      </main>

   2. Change the IP address, port, and directories of the server, and configure the memory parameters and the password.

      ```yaml
      oceanbase-ce:
        servers:
          # Do not use the hostname. Only IP address is supported.
          - name: server1
            ip: 10.10.10.1
          - name: server2
            ip: 10.10.10.2
          - name: server3
            ip: 10.10.10.3
        global:
          devname: eth0
          cluster_id: 1
          # Set the memory limit to a suitable value that matches the memory resource.
          memory_limit: 64G # The maximum running memory for an observer
          system_memory: 30G # The reserved system memory. system_memory is reserved for general tenants.
          datafile_size: 192G # Size of the data file.
          log_disk_size: 192G # The size of disk space used by the clog files.
          enable_syslog_wf: false # Specifies whether to print system logs whose levels are higher than WARNING to a separate log file. Default value: true.
          enable_syslog_recycle: true # Specifies whether to enable auto system log recycling. Default value: false.
          max_syslog_file_count: 4 # The maximum number of reserved log files before enabling auto recycling. The default value is 0.
          ocp_meta_tenant: # The config for ocp express meta tenant
            tenant_name: ocp
            max_cpu: 1
            memory_size: 2G
            log_disk_size: 7680M
          mysql_port: 2881 # External port for OceanBase Database. The default value is 2881. DO NOT change this value after the cluster is started.
          rpc_port: 2882 # Internal port for OceanBase Database. The default value is 2882. DO NOT change this value after the cluster is started.
          # The working directory for OceanBase Database. OceanBase Database is started under this directory. This is a required field.
          home_path: /home/admin/observer
          # The directory for data storage. Default value: $home_path/store.
          data_dir: /data
          # The directory for clog, ilog, and slog files. Default value: the same as the value of the data_dir parameter.
          redo_dir: /redo
          root_password: ****** # root user password, can be empty
          proxyro_password: ******** # proxyro user pasword, consistent with obproxy's observer_sys_password, can be empty
        server1:
          zone: zone1
        server2:
          zone: zone2
        server3:
          zone: zone3
      ```

      If a parameter has different values on different servers, you can specify this parameter for these servers in the configuration file. The server-specific parameters in the configuration file have a higher priority than `global` parameters. The following example shows that different ports are configured for two servers:

      ```yaml
      server2:
        mysql_port: 3881
        rpc_port: 3882
        zone: zone2
      server3:
        mysql_port: 2881
        rpc_port: 2882
        zone: zone3
      ```

      | Parameter | Required? | Default value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
      |----------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | servers | Yes | N/A | Each server is specified in the `- name: Server name (line break) ip: Server IP address` format. You can specify multiple servers in this format. The server names must be unique. </br>If the server IP addresses are unique, you can also specify servers in the `- <ip> (line break)- <ip>` format, in which `- <ip>` is equivalent to `- name: Server name (line break) ip: Server IP address`.                                                                                                                                                      |
      | devname | No | N/A | The NIC corresponding to the IP address specified for the `servers` parameter. You can run the `ip addr` command to view the mappings between IP addresses and NICs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
      | memory_limit | No | 0 | The maximum memory in the system available for the observer process. If this parameter is not specified, the value of `memory_limit_percentage` takes effect.                        |
      | system_memory | No | 0M | The reserved system memory. The system memory is part of the memory specified for the `memory_limit` parameter. If `system_memory` is not specified, OceanBase Database automatically adapts the size of the reserved system memory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### Step 3: Deploy the OceanBase cluster

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>For more information about the commands used in this topic, see <a href="https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000904961">Cluster commands</a> in the OBD documentation. </p>
</main>

1. Deploy the OceanBase cluster.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster deploy obtest -c default-components.yaml
   ```

   After you run the `obd cluster deploy` command, if your server is connected to the Internet, OBD checks whether the desired installation package exists on the target server. If no, OBD automatically obtains the installation package from the YUM source.

2. Start the OceanBase cluster.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster start obtest
   ```

   If OCP Express is installed, the access URL of OCP Express is generated. In Alibaba Cloud or other cloud environments, the installation program may not be able to obtain a public IP address and therefore will generate an internal IP address. You must replace it with a correct public IP address.

3. View the status of the OceanBase cluster.

   ```shell
   # View the list of clusters managed by OBD.
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster list

   # View the status of the obtest cluster.
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster display obtest
   ```

4. (Optional) Modify the cluster configurations.

   OceanBase Database has hundreds of parameters and some are coupled. We recommend that you do not modify parameters in the sample configuration file before you become familiar with OceanBase Database. The following example shows you how to modify a parameter and make it take effect.

   ```shell
   # Run the edit-config command to enter the edit mode before you can edit the cluster configurations.
   # After you modify and save the configurations and exit, OBD will prompt how to validate the modifications. Copy the command provided by OBD.
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster edit-config obtest
   Search param plugin and load ok
   Search param plugin and load ok
   Parameter check ok
   Save deploy "obtest" configuration
   Use `obd cluster reload obtest` to make changes take effect.
   [admin@test001 ~]$ obd cluster reload obtest
   ```

### Step 4: Connect to the OceanBase cluster

Run the following command to connect to the OceanBase cluster by using OBClient:

```shell
obclient -h<IP> -P<PORT> -uroot@sys -p -c -A
# example
obclient -h10.10.10.4 -P2883 -uroot@sys -p -c -A
```

In this command, `IP` is the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. `PORT` is the port for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is the value of `mysql_port` if you connect to the database directly or the value of `listen_port` if you connect to the database by using ODP.

<!-- For more information about how to connect to an OceanBase cluster by using OBClient, see [Connect to an OceanBase Database tenant by using OBClient](../../../3.develop/1.application-development-of-mysql-mode/1.database-connection-with-client-of-mysql-mode/3.connect-to-an-oceanbase-tenant-by-using-obclient-of-mysql-mode.md). -->

### Step 5: Create user tenants

After you deploy the OceanBase cluster, we recommend that you create user tenants for business operations. The `sys` tenant is intended only for cluster management and is unsuitable for business scenarios.

You can create a user tenant by using the following methods:

* Method 1: Create a user tenant by using OBD.

   ```shell
   obd cluster tenant create <deploy name> [-n <tenant name>] [flags]
   # example
   obd cluster tenant create test -n obmysql --max-cpu=2 --memory-size=2G --log-disk-size=3G --max-iops=10000 --iops-weight=2 --unit-num=1 --charset=utf8
   ```

   This command automatically creates a tenant based on all remaining resources of the cluster. You can configure the related parameters to control the resources available for the tenant. For more information, see the description of the `obd cluster tenant create` command in [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000904961) of the OBD documentation.

* Method 2: Create a user tenant by using a CLI. 
  
  <!-- For more information, see [Create a user tenant](../../../7.reference/2.administrator-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants/3.create-a-user-tenant.md). -->

### Manage clusters

You can run the following commands to manage clusters deployed by using OBD. For more information about the commands, see [Cluster commands](https://en.oceanbase.com/docs/community-obd-en-10000000000904961) in the OBD documentation.

```shell
# View the cluster list.
obd cluster list

# View the status of the obtest cluster.
obd cluster display obtest

# Stop the running obtest cluster.
obd cluster stop obtest

# Destroy the obtest cluster.
obd cluster destroy obtest
```

### Uninstall the all-in-one package

To uninstall the all-in-one package, perform the following steps:

1. Uninstall the package.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ cd oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/
   [admin@test001 bin]$ ./uninstall.sh
   ```

2. Delete the environment variable.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 bin]$ vim ~/.bash_profile
   # Delete source /home/admin/.oceanbase-all-in-one/bin/env.sh from this file.
   ```

3. Make the modification take effect.
   For example, after you delete the environment variable, you must log on to the client again or run the following `source` command for the modification to take effect:

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ source ~/.bash_profile
   ```
