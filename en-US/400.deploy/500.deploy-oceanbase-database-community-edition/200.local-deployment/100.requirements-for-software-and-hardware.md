# Software and hardware requirements

OceanBase Database is a distributed database management system that requires at least three servers in the production environment. In a learning environment, you can deploy a standalone instance. OceanBase Database is similar to conventional databases in deployment. In this topic, suggestions for the operating system, hardware, and software are provided based on best practices. These are the basis for OceanBase Database to achieve high performance and run stably.

## Software resources

The following table provides links for downloading the installation packages of OceanBase Database that are suitable for different operating systems.

| Operating system | RPM package |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Alibaba Cloud Linux 2, CentOS 7, Red Hat 7, Ubuntu 20.X, Debian 9.X | [RPM packages for el7](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/7/x86_64/) |
| Alibaba Cloud Linux 3, CentOS 8, Red Hat 8, Debian 10, Anolis OS 8.X | [Download RPM packages for el8](https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/community/stable/el/8/x86_64/) |

When you deploy a small number of clusters, we recommend that you use OceanBase Deployer (OBD) for installation and deployment. </p></main> |
| Disk type | SSD is recommended. |
| Disk space | At least 20 GB is required. |
| File system | EXT4 or XFS. Choose XFS when the data volume exceeds 16 TB. |
| NIC | Gigabit Ethernet and above |

More software and hardware platforms are currently being tested for compatibility.

  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If you plan to deploy an OceanBase cluster, make sure that all servers in the cluster have the same configurations. In this topic, the resource requirements on the performance test environment and production environment are for reference only. In later versions of OceanBase Database Community Edition, the requirement on memory will be lowered. </p>
