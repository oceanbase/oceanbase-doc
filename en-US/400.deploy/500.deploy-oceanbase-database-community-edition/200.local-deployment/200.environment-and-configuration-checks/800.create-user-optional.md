# (Optional) Create a user

This topic describes how to create a user and grant the sudo permission to the user.

If you are an individual user, you can deploy OceanBase Database as the root user and skip this topic. If you are an enterprise user, we recommend that you create non-root users for the servers to ensure data security. You can create frequently used users as needed.

To create a user and grant the sudo permission to the user, follow these steps:

1. Run the following commands to create an admin user:

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# useradd -U admin -d /home/admin -s /bin/bash
   [root@test001 ~]# chown -R admin:admin /home/admin
   ```

2. Run the following command to set a password for the admin user:

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# passwd admin
   ```

3. (Optional) Set the sudo permission for the admin user.

   Run the following command to open the `/etc/sudoers` file:

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# vim /etc/sudoers
   ```

   Add the following line at the end of the `/etc/sudoers` file:

   ```shell
   ## Same thing without a password
   # %wheel        ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   admin       ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
   ```

4. Run the following command to check the directory permissions of the cluster-related files.

   Taking the `data` directory as an example:

   ```shell
   [root@test001 data]# ls -al
   ```

   The result will be:

   ```shell
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 02/09 18:43 .
   drwxr-xr-x 2 admin admin 4096 02/09 18:43 log1
   ```

   If you find that the `admin` user does not have the necessary permissions for the files, you can change the file ownership with the commands below:

   ```shell
   [root@test001 ~]# chown -R admin:admin /data
   [root@test001 ~]# chown -R admin:admin /redo
   ```

   Here, `/data` and `/redo` are example mount directories. You need to replace them with your actual mount directories.
