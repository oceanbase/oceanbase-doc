# (Optional) Check resources

If you are planning to deploy a distributed OceanBase cluster, we recommend that you use identical software and hardware configurations on all servers during deployment. For more information, see [Software and hardware requirements](../100.requirements-for-software-and-hardware.md).

If you are planning to deploy a standalone OceanBase database, skip this step.

## View the kernel information

Run the following command:

```shell
uname -r
```

The version of the operating system used by OceanBase Database must be V3.10.0 or later.

## View the memory information

Run the following command:

```shell
free -g
```

If the available memory is less than the value of `memory_limit` in the configuration file, clear the cache or set `memory_limit` to a value smaller than the available memory.

Run the following command to clear the cache:

```shell
sudo sysctl -w vm.drop_caches=3
# or
sudo echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches
```

## View the disk information

Run the following command:

```shell
df -h
```

Make sure that the disks corresponding to the `data_dir`, `redo_dir`, and `home_path` directories in the configuration file are properly mounted. The directories corresponding to `data_dir` and `redo_dir` should be empty, and the disk usage for the directory corresponding to `data_dir` must be below 4%.

## View the NIC name

You need to specify the NIC for the `devname` parameter. Here is a sample configuration file:

```shell
# Please set devname as the network adaptor's name whose ip is  in the setting of severs.
# if set severs as "127.0.0.1", please set devname as "lo"
# if current ip is 192.168.1.10, and the ip's network adaptor's name is "eth0", please use "eth0"
devname: eth0
```

Run the following command to view the NIC name:

```shell
ifconfig
```
