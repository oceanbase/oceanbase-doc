## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure that the following conditions are met:

* You are using one of the following RPM-based operating systems: 

   * CentOS Linux 7.X and 8.X

   * Anolis OS 8.X and 23

   * openSUSE 15.X

   * openEuler 22.03

* You have installed jq, a command-line tool, in your environment and configured systemd as the system and service manager. 

* You have installed the mysql client or OceanBase Client (OBClient) in your environment for database connection. 

* You are going to deploy OceanBase Database V4.2.2 or later. 

* You have the permissions to run sudo commands. 

## Deploy OceanBase Database

### Step 1: Install OceanBase Database

You can install OceanBase Database online or offline, depending on whether your environment is connected to the Internet. 

:::tab
tab Online installation

1. Add the OceanBase image source.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
   ```

2. Install OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum install oceanbase-ce
   ```

   By default, the preceding command deploys OceanBase Database of the latest version. You can install a specific version by declaring the version number. For example, you can use the `yum install oceanbase-ce-4.2.2.0` command to install OceanBase Database V4.2.2. We recommend that you install the latest version. 

tab Offline installation

1. Visit [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) to download OceanBase Database of the required version and the matched dependent libraries (OceanBase Libs). Then, copy the downloaded packages to your server. We recommend that you download the latest version. 

2. Run the rpm command in the directory where the installation package is located to install OceanBase Database. 

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ rpm -ivh oceanbase-ce-*.rpm
   ```

:::

### Step 2: Start OceanBase Database

You can start OceanBase Database by performing the following steps: 

1. (Optional) Modify the configuration file.

   Run the following command to open the configuration file and modify it by referring to this step. If you skip this step, default configurations are used. 

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ vim /etc/oceanbase.cnf
   ```

   The configuration file contains the following parameters:

   ```shell
   mysqlPort=2881
   rootPwd=""
   redoDir=/var/lib/oceanbase/redo
   dataDir=/var/lib/oceanbase/data
   datafile_size=2G
   cpu_count=16
   memory_limit=6G
   system_memory=1G
   log_disk_size=13G
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>You can add other parameters to the configuration file. For more information about the parameters, see <a href='../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/200.system-configuration-items-overview-list.md'>Parameter summary</a>. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>By default, the IP address of the OBServer node is <code>127.0.0.1</code> and the zone is <code>zone1</code>. You cannot modify the two parameters. </p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

   The following table describes parameters in the configuration file.

   | Parameter | Required? | Default value | Description |
   |----------|-----------|----------|----------|
   | mysqlPort | No | 2881 | The port number for the SQL service protocol of OceanBase Database.  |
   | rootPwd | No | Empty | The password of the super administrator (`root@sys`) of the OceanBase cluster. We recommend that you set a complex password.  |
   | redoDir | No | /var/lib/oceanbase/redo | The directory for storing clogs, ilogs, and slogs. We recommend that you set the directory on a separate disk.  |
   | dataDir | No | /var/lib/oceanbase/data | The directory for storing SSTables and other data. We recommend that you set the directory on a separate disk.  |
   | datafile_size | No | 0 | The size of the data file `block_file` on the corresponding OBServer node. If this parameter is not configured, the `datafile_disk_percentage` parameter takes effect. For more information, see [datafile_size](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/5400.datafile_size.md) and [datafile_disk_percentage](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/5300.datafile_disk_percentage.md).  |
   | cpu_count | No | 0 | The total number of CPU cores that OceanBase Database can use. If you set the parameter to 0, the system will automatically detect the number of CPU cores.  |
   | memory_limit | No | 0 | The maximum memory that the observer process can obtain from the environment. If this parameter is not configured, the `memory_limit_percentage` parameter takes effect. For more information about the two parameters, see [memory_limit](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/13600.memory_limit.md) and [memory_limit_percentage](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/13700.memory_limit_percentage.md).  |
   | system_memory | No | 0M | The reserved system memory, which is part of `memory_limit`. If this parameter is not configured, OceanBase Database reserves memory for the system in adaptive mode.  |
   | log_disk_size | No | 0 | The size of the redo log disk. If this parameter is not configured, the `log_disk_percentage` parameter takes effect. For more information, see [log_disk_size](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/23700.log_disk_size.md) and [log_disk_percentage](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/23800.log_disk_percentage.md).  |

2. Start OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl start oceanbase
   ```

### Step 3: Connect to OceanBase Database

In this example, OBClient is used to connect to OceanBase Database. Run the following command:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h127.0.0.1 -uroot@sys -P2881 -p -A oceanbase
```

where

* `-h` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. If you start OceanBase Database by using systemd, the IP address is `127.0.0.1` by default. 

* `-u` specifies the tenant account in the `username@tenant name` format. The default username of the administrator of a MySQL tenant is `root`. 

* `-P` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database. If you start OceanBase Database by using systemd, the port number is `2881` by default. 

* `-p` specifies the password of the tenant account for connecting to OceanBase Database. Instead of providing the password in the command, we recommend that you enter the password as prompted after you run the command. This way, the password is masked. 

* `-A` specifies not to automatically retrieve the statistical information when connecting to OceanBase Database. 

* `oceanbase` specifies the name of the database to access. You can change it to the name of a business database. 

## Manage OceanBase Database

Currently, you can use systemd only to start, stop, and view the status of OceanBase Database. 

* View the status of OceanBase Database

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl status oceanbase
   ```

   OceanBase Database may be in one of the following states:

   * If the value of the `Active` field is `active (running)`, and that of the `Status` field is `Service is running`, OceanBase Database is being started. 

   * If the value of the `Active` field is `active (running)`, and that of the `Status` field is `Service is ready`, OceanBase Database is successfully started. 

   * If the value of the `Active` field is `inactive (dead)`, OceanBase Database is stopped. 

   * If the value of the `Active` field is `failed`, an error occurred to OceanBase Database and you must check the logs for troubleshooting. 

* Stop OceanBase Database

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl stop oceanbase
   ```

* Uninstall OceanBase Database

   We recommend that you stop OceanBase Database first, and then perform the following steps to uninstall it: 

   1. Delete the package of OceanBase Database.

      If you have installed OceanBase Database online, run the following command to delete the package:

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum erase package 
      ```

      You must replace `package` with the actual name of the package to be deleted. To view the package name, run the `yum list | grep oceanbase` command. 

      If you have installed OceanBase Database offline, run the following command to delete the package:

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo rpm -e package
      ```

      You must replace `package` with the actual name of the package to be deleted. To view the package name, run the `rpm -qa | grep oceanbase` command. 

   2. (Optional) Delete the data of OceanBase Database.

      After you perform the preceding step, OceanBase Database is uninstalled from your environment, but the database data still exists. If you redeploy OceanBase Database later, you can view and use the data. 

      After you perform this step, the data of OceanBase Database is completely deleted. 

      Delete the installation directory of OceanBase Database.

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ rm -rf /home/admin/oceanbase 
      ```

      Delete the data directory of OceanBase Database.

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ rm -rf /var/lib/oceanbase 
      ```
