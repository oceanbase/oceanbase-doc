## Deploy OceanBase Database

### Step 1: Install OceanBase Database

You can install OceanBase Database online or offline, depending on whether your environment is connected to the Internet.

:::tab
tab Online installation

1. Add the OceanBase image source.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://mirrors.aliyun.com/oceanbase/OceanBase.repo
   ```

2. Install OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum install oceanbase-ce oceanbase-ce-libs obclient
   ```

   By default, the preceding command deploys OceanBase Database of the latest version. You can install a specific version by declaring the version number. For example, you can use the `yum install oceanbase-ce-4.2.2.0` command to install OceanBase Database V4.2.2. We recommend that you install the latest version.

tab Offline installation

1. Visit [OceanBase Download Center](https://en.oceanbase.com/softwarecenter) to download OceanBase Database of the required version and the matched dependent libraries (OceanBase Libs). Then, copy the downloaded packages to your server. We recommend that you download the latest version.

2. Run the rpm command in the directory where the installation package is located to install OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo rpm -ivh oceanbase-ce-*.rpm
   ```

:::

### Step 2: Start OceanBase Database

You can start OceanBase Database by performing the following steps:

1. (Optional) Modify the configuration file.

   Run the following command to open the configuration file and modify it by referring to this step. If you skip this step, default configurations are used.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo vim /etc/oceanbase.cnf
   ```

   The configuration file contains the following parameters:

   ```shell
   ip=127.0.0.1
   mysql_port=2881
   rpc_port=2882
   obshell_port=2886
   root_pwd=""
   redo_dir=/var/lib/oceanbase/redo
   data_dir=/var/lib/oceanbase/data
   datafile_size=2G
   cpu_count=16
   memory_limit=6G
   system_memory=1G
   log_disk_size=13G
   ```

   <main id="notice" type='explain'>
     <h4>Note</h4>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <p>You can add other parameters to the configuration file. For more information about the parameters, see <a href='../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/200.system-configuration-items-overview-list.md'>Parameter summary</a>. </p>
     </li>
     <li>
     <p>At present, you cannot modify the zone of an OBServer node, which is <code>zone1</code> by default. </p>
     </li>
     </ul>
   </main>

   The following table describes parameters in the configuration file.

   | Parameter | Required | Default value | Description |
   |----------|-----------|----------|----------|
   | ip | No | 127.0.0.1 | The IP address of the OBServer node. At present, you cannot specify an IPv6 address for an OBServer node.  |
   | mysql_port | No | 2881 | The SQL port of OceanBase Database.  |
   | rpc_port | No | 2882 | The RPC port of OceanBase Database.  |
   | obshell_port | No | 2886 | The O&M port of OceanBase Database.  |
   | root_pwd | No | Empty | The password of the super administrator (`root@sys`) of the OceanBase cluster. We recommend that you set a complex password.  |
   | redo_dir | No | /var/lib/oceanbase/redo | The directory for storing clogs, ilogs, and slogs. We recommend that you set the directory on a separate disk. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>The available space of the data disk (<code>/var/lib/oceanbase/</code> by default) must be greater than 15 GB. </p></main> |
   | data_dir | No | /var/lib/oceanbase/data | The directory for storing SSTables and other data. We recommend that you use a separate disk. <main id="notice" type='explain'><h4>Note</h4><p>The available space of the data disk (<code>/var/lib/oceanbase/</code> by default) must be greater than 15 GB. </p></main> |
   | datafile_size | No | 0 | The size of the data file `block_file` on the corresponding OBServer node. If this parameter is not configured, the `datafile_disk_percentage` parameter takes effect. For more information, see [datafile_size](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/4700.datafile_size.md) and [datafile_disk_percentage](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/4400.datafile_disk_percentage.md).  |
   | cpu_count | No | 0 | The total number of CPU cores that OceanBase Database can use. If you set the parameter to 0, the system will automatically detect the number of CPU cores.  |
   | memory_limit | No | 0 | The maximum memory that the observer process can obtain from the environment. If this parameter is not configured, the `memory_limit_percentage` parameter takes effect. For more information about the two parameters, see [memory_limit](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/13500.memory_limit.md) and [memory_limit_percentage](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/13600.memory_limit_percentage.md).  |
   | system_memory | No | 0M | The reserved system memory, which is part of `memory_limit`. If this parameter is not configured, OceanBase Database reserves memory for the system in adaptive mode.  |
   | log_disk_size | No | 0 | The size of the redo log disk. If this parameter is not configured, the `log_disk_percentage` parameter takes effect. For more information, see [log_disk_size](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/12700.log_disk_size.md) and [log_disk_percentage](../../../700.reference/800.configuration-items-and-system-variables/100.system-configuration-items/300.cluster-level-configuration-items/12600.log_disk_percentage.md).  |

2. Modify the owner of the `etc` directory in the installation directory of OceanBase Database. By default, the installation directory is `/home/admin/oceanbase`.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo chown root /home/admin/oceanbase/etc
   ```

3. Start OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl start oceanbase
   ```

4. View the startup status of OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl status oceanbase
   ```

   If `Service is ready` is displayed, OceanBase Database has been started.

### Step 3: Connect to OceanBase Database

In this example, OBClient is used to connect to OceanBase Database. Run the following command:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ obclient -h<IP> -uroot@sys -P<Port> -p<Passwd> -A oceanbase
```

where

* `-h` specifies the IP address for connecting to OceanBase Database. If you start OceanBase Database by using systemd, the IP address is `127.0.0.1` by default.

* `-u` specifies the account for connecting to OceanBase Database, in the format of `username@tenant name`. The default username of the administrator of a MySQL tenant is `root`.

* `-P` specifies the port for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is the value of `mysqlPort` in the `oceanbase.cnf` configuration file in the `etc` directory.

* `-p` specifies the password for connecting to OceanBase Database, which is the value of `rootPwd` in the `oceanbase.cnf` configuration file in the `etc` directory. Instead of providing the password in the command, we recommend that you enter the password as prompted after you run the command. This way, the password is masked.

* `-A` specifies not to automatically retrieve statistics when connecting to OceanBase Database by using OBClient.

* `oceanbase` specifies the name of the database to access. You can change it to the name of a business database.

## Manage OceanBase Database

Currently, you can use systemd only to start, stop, and view the status of OceanBase Database.

### View the status of OceanBase Database

Run the following command to query the status of OceanBase Database:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl status oceanbase
```

OceanBase Database may be in one of the following states:

* If the value of the `Active` field is `active (running)`, and that of the `Status` field is `Service is running`, OceanBase Database is being started.

* If the value of the `Active` field is `active (running)`, and that of the `Status` field is `Service is ready`, OceanBase Database is successfully started.

* If the value of the `Active` field is `inactive (dead)`, OceanBase Database is stopped.

* If the value of the `Active` field is `failed`, an error occurred to OceanBase Database and you must check the logs for troubleshooting.

### View detailed logs of OceanBase Database

When OceanBase Database is abnormal, you can run the following command to view the detailed logs of OceanBase Database:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ sudo journalctl -u oceanbase
```

Actually, systemd sends requests to communicate with the management tool OBShell of OceanBase Database, thereby controlling the status of OBServer nodes. Many trace IDs are recorded in logs. You can use OBShell APIs in conjunction with these trace IDs for troubleshooting. The command is as follows:

```shell
[admin@test001 ~]$ curl -X GET http://<ip>:<obshell_port>/api/v1/task/dag/<trace id> | jq
```

If an error is returned in the `observer start` or `bootstrap` phase, you also need to view the logs of the OBServer node, which are stored in the `/home/admin/oceanbase/log` directory by default.

#### FAQ

* ERROR: current user(uid=0) that starts observer is not the same with the original one(uid=500)

   A common cause is that the owner of the `etc` directory in the installation directory of OceanBase Database, which is `/home/admin/oceanbase` by default, is not the current user. In this case, you can run the following command:

   ```shell
   chown root /home/admin/oceanbase/etc
   ```

* errcode=-4290, file="ob_server_log_block_mgr.cpp", line_no=1127, info="::fallocate failed"

   A common cause is that the available space of the data disk of OceanBase Database, which is `/var/lib/oceanbase/` by default, is insufficient. In this case, you can increase the data disk space.

### Clear OceanBase Database

You can perform the following steps to clear OceanBase Database started by using systemd:

1. Stop OceanBase Database.

   ```shell
   [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo systemctl stop oceanbase
   ```

2. Uninstall OceanBase Database.

   1. Delete the package of OceanBase Database.

      If you have installed OceanBase Database online, run the following command to delete the package:

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo yum erase package
      ```

      You must replace `package` with the actual name of the package to be deleted. To view the package name, run the `yum list | grep oceanbase` command.

      If you have installed OceanBase Database offline, run the following command to delete the package:

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo rpm -e package
      ```

      You must replace `package` with the actual name of the package to be deleted. To view the package name, run the `rpm -qa | grep oceanbase` command.

   2. (Optional) Delete the data of OceanBase Database.

      After you perform the preceding step, OceanBase Database is uninstalled from your environment, but the database data still exists. If you redeploy OceanBase Database later, you can view and use the data.

      After you perform this step, the data of OceanBase Database is completely deleted.

      Delete the installation directory of OceanBase Database.

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo rm -rf /home/admin/oceanbase
      ```

      Delete the data directory of OceanBase Database.

      ```shell
      [admin@test001 ~]$ sudo rm -rf /var/lib/oceanbase
      ```
