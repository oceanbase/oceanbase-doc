# LEFT JOIN queries

A LEFT JOIN query is a LEFT OUTER JOIN query that returns all records in the left-side table and the matching records in the right-side table. The matching records in the right-side table are records that meet the join condition. 

## Background information

An OUTER JOIN query uses a comparison operator to compare the data in two tables. The join results include the rows that meet the join conditions and those that do not meet the join conditions. 

OUTER JOIN queries include FULL JOIN queries, LEFT JOIN queries, and RIGHT JOIN queries. An outer join returns all the rows that meet the join conditions. In addition, it returns unused rows of one table and fills `NULL` in the corresponding positions from the other table. 

This topic describes how to use LEFT JOIN queries. For more information about FULL JOIN queries and RIGHT JOIN queries, see [FULL JOIN queries](2.full-join.md) and [RIGHT JOIN queries](4.right-join.md). 

## Syntax

Generally, an OUTER JOIN statement contains a left-side table and a right-side table. The leftmost table in the JOIN clause is the left-side table, and the rightmost table in the JOIN clause is the right-side table.

Syntax:

```sql
SELECT select_list FROM table_name1 LEFT JOIN table_name2 ON join_condition
[ WHERE query_condition ]
[ ORDER BY column_list ];
```

`table_name1` is the left-side table and `table_name2` is the right-side table. 

## Examples

Create a table and insert proper data into the table. 

```sql
obclient [info]> CREATE TABLE tbl_a(id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(50));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [info]> CREATE TABLE tbl_b(number INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, value INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient [info]> INSERT INTO tbl_a VALUES(1,'ab'),(2,'cd'),(3,'ef'),(4,'gh');
Query OK, 6 rows affected
Records: 6  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0

obclient [info]> INSERT INTO tbl_b VALUES(1,1001),(3,1003),(5,1005);
Query OK, 4 rows affected
Records: 4  Duplicates: 0  Warnings: 0
```

### Simple LEFT JOIN queries

To use a `JOIN` clause to return data that meets the join and filter conditions and also to return data from the left-side table that meets the filter condition specified for the left-side table but does not meet the join condition, you can use `LEFT OUTER JOIN`, or `LEFT JOIN` for short. 

In a LEFT JOIN query, if a row in the left-side table is not found in the right-side table, NULL is automatically filled in this row of the right-side table. 

Example 1: Execute a LEFT JOIN query on the `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` tables and obtain the returned results. 

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a LEFT JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number;
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    1 | ab   |      1 |  1001 |
|    2 | cd   |   NULL |  NULL |
|    3 | ef   |      3 |  1003 |
|    4 | gh   |   NULL |  NULL |
+------+------+--------+-------+
4 rows in set
```

### LEFT JOIN queries with a WHERE clause

You can use a LEFT JOIN query to obtain the join result and then use the WHERE clause to filter the result.

Example 2: Execute a LEFT JOIN query on the `tbl_a` and `tbl_b` tables and return the data that meets the `name='ab'` condition in the `tbl_a` table. 

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a;
+------+------+
| id   | name |
+------+------+
|    1 | ab   |
|    2 | cd   |
|    3 | ef   |
|    4 | gh   |
+------+------+
4 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_b;
+--------+-------+
| number | value |
+--------+-------+
|      1 |  1001 |
|      3 |  1003 |
|      5 |  1005 |
+--------+-------+
3 rows in set

obclient> SELECT * FROM tbl_a LEFT JOIN tbl_b ON tbl_a.id=tbl_b.number WHERE tbl_a.name='ab';
+------+------+--------+-------+
| id   | name | number | value |
+------+------+--------+-------+
|    1 | ab   |      1 |  1001 |
+------+------+--------+-------+
1 row in set
```
