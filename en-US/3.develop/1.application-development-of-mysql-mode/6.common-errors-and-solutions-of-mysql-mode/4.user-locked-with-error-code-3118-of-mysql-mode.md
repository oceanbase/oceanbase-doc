# User locked, with ERROR 3118 reported

This topic describes how to handle `ERROR 3118`, where a user is locked in OceanBase Database in MySQL mode. 

## Symptom

If you enter an incorrect password multiple times when you log on to the `MySQL` tenant by using the `ny1` user account, the system reports an error indicating that the user is locked. 

```sql
[admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
$obclient -h10.10.10.1 -P2881 -uny1@MySQL -p**8*** -A
ERROR 3118 (HY000): User locked
```

The error codes corresponding to this error message are as follows:

* Error code: ERROR 3118

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 5039

* MySQL error code: 3118

For more information about the error codes, see [Overview](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/6.error-code-for-mysql/1.use-error-information-1.md). 

## Possible causes

OceanBase Database provides a mechanism to handle logon failures. If a user fails to log on to OceanBase Database multiple times, OceanBase Database locks the account of the user to prevent malicious password attacks. This improves the security of OceanBase Database. For more information about how to handle logon failures, see [Handle logon failures](../../../7.reference/2.manage-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants-1/5.manage-users-and-permissions/3.mysql-3/3.logon-failure-handling-policy-1.md). 

## Troubleshooting procedure

Take the following steps to unlock the user and log on again. 

1. Log on to the tenant as the administrator. The default username of the administrator of a MySQL tenant is `root`. 

   > **Note**
   >
   > If you log on as the administrator, you can directly unlock users. If you log on as a regular user, you must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege to unlock users. 

2. Unlock the `ny1` user. 

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER USER 'ny1' account UNLOCK;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

3. Use the `ny1` account to log on to the corresponding tenant of the database again. 

   ```sql
   [admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
   $obclient -hxx.xx.xx.1 -P2881 -uny1@MySQL -p**8*** -A
