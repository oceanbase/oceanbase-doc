# Incorrect user password, with ERROR 1045 reported

This topic describes how to handle `ERROR 1045`, where an incorrect password is entered for logon in OceanBase Database in MySQL mode. 

## Symptom

The system reports an error when you enter an incorrect password for logon. 

```sql
[admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
$obclient -hxx.xx.xx.1 -P2881 -uny1@MySQL -p**8*** -A
ERROR 1045 (42000): Access denied for user 'ny1'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (using password: YES)
```

The error codes corresponding to this error message are as follows:

* Error code: ERROR 1045

* Error code in OceanBase Database: 4043

* MySQL error code: 1045

For more information about the error codes, see [Overview](../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/6.error-code-of-mysql-mode/1.use-error-information-of-mysql-mode.md). 

## Troubleshooting procedure

Take the following steps to change the password for a user and log on again. 

1. Log on to the tenant as the administrator.  

   > **Note**
   >
   > If you log on as the administrator, you can directly change the passwords for users. If you log on as a regular user, you must have the global `CREATE USER` privilege to change the password of another user. 

2. Change the password of the `ny1` user. 

   ```sql
   obclient> ALTER USER 'ny1' IDENTIFIED BY '**8***';
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > When you set the password for a user, the password must meet the password complexity requirements of the current tenant. For more information about password complexity, see [Set password complexity rules](../../../7.reference/2.administrator-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants/9.manage-users-and-permissions/3.mysql-mode/2.set-password-complexity-of-mysql-mode.md). 

3. Use the `ny1` account to log on to the database again. 

   ```sql
   [admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
   $obclient -h10.10.10.1 -P2881 -uny1@MySQL -p**8*** -A
