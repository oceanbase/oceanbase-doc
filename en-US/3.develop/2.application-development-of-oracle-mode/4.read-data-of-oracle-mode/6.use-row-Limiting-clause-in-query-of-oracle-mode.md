# Use Row_Limiting_Clause in queries

You can use `Row_Limiting_Clause` to limit the number of rows returned for a `SELECT` query. This feature is often used in pagination.

### Parameters

| Field | Description |
|----------|-----------------------|
| hint_options | Optional. The hint option.  |
| DISTINCT \| UNIQUE \| ALL | The returned data may contain duplicate rows. <ul><li>If you specify `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE`, rows are deduplicated in the query results. `DISTINCT` and `UNIQUE` are synonyms. </li><li> If you specify `ALL`, all rows are returned in the query results. The default value is `ALL`.    </li></ul> |
| select_expr_list | The expression or names of columns to query from the database. Separate multiple names with commas (,). The value "\*" indicates all columns.  <ul><li>`table_name.*`: specifies all columns in the specified table or view. </li><li> `table_alias_name.`: the alias of the table or view.  </li><li> `expr [[AS] column_alias_name]`: the alias of the column or expression that you want to query. `AS` is optional. </li></ul> |
| FROM table_references | The object from which data is selected.  |
| PARTITION(partition_list) | Specifies the partition information of the table to be queried. For example: `partition(p0,p1…)` |
| table_alias_name | The alias of the object from which data is selected, in the format of original name+space+alias.  |
| joined_table | The join method in a multi-table query. <ul><li>`[INNER] JOIN` indicates inner join and `INNER` is optional. Only the data that meets the join conditions is returned. </li><li> `[OUTER] JOIN` indicates outer join and `OUTER` is optional. <ul><li>`LEFT [OUTER]` indicates left (outer) join. The values of all public columns in the table on the left side are returned. </li><li> `RIGHT [OUTER]` indicates right (outer) join. The values of all public columns in the table on the right side are returned. </li><li> `FULL [OUTER]` indicates full (outer) join. The rows that are not returned in the inner join results of two tables are reserved and filled with null values. </li></ul></li></ul> |
| ON expression | The join condition in a multi-table join.  |
| WHERE where_conditions | Optional. The filter condition. Only data that meets the condition is returned in the query results. `where_conditions` is an expression.  |
| GROUP BY group_by_list | The grouping field, which is usually used together with aggregate functions.  <blockquote><b>Note</b></br>If no column following the `SELECT` clause uses any aggregate function, in a GROUP BY query, the columns following the `SELECT` clause must be specified in the `GROUP BY` clause. </blockquote> |
| ROLLUP group_expression_list | Rolls up the results of the groups created by the GROUP BY clause and generates the statistics.  |
| GROUPING SETS group_expression_list | Specifies two or more data groups in a query, generates statistics, and aggregates and displays the statistics of the specified group. You can specify a single field or a list of fields in `GROUPING SETS`.  |
| HAVING search_confitions | Filters the grouped data. The `HAVING` clause is similar to the `WHERE` clause, but the `HAVING` clause can reference an aggregate function such as `SUM` and `AVG`.  |
| ORDER BY order_list | Sorts the query results by one or multiple columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. If you do not specify `ASC` or `DESC`, the default value `ASC` prevails.  <ul><li>`ASC` indicates ascending order. </li><li> `DESC` indicates descending order. </li></ul> |
| row_limiting_clause | Restricts the rows returned by a query, to implement querying by page. You can specify the offset and the number of rows or percentage of rows to return. It can be used together with the `ORDER BY` clause to ensure the sorting order, to obtain consistent results.  |
| OFFSET | The number of rows to skip before a query by page begins.  `offset` must be a numeric value or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. <ul><li>If you specify a negative number, `offset` is taken as 0. </li><li>If you set it to `NULL` or a value equal to or greater than the number of rows returned by the query, 0 rows are returned.  </li><li>If `offset` contains a fraction, the fraction is truncated. </li><li> If this clause is not specified, the offset is 0 and pagination starts from the first row. </li></ul> |
| ROW \| ROWS | Indicates a single row or multiple rows. You can select the keyword based on the number of rows to ensure clear semantics. |
| FETCH | The number of rows or percentage of rows to return. If this clause is not specified, all rows starting from the (`offset` + 1)th row are returned.  |
| FIRST \| NEXT | The number or percentage of rows to return in the first or next response. |
| rowcount \| percent PERCENT | Use `rowcount` to specify the number of rows to return. `rowcount` must be a numeric value or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. If you specify a negative number, `rowcount` is taken as 0. If `rowcount` is greater than the number of available rows starting from the (`rowcount` +1)th row, all available rows are returned. If `rowcount` contains a fraction, the fraction is truncated. If `rowcount` is set to `NULL`, 0 rows are returned.</br>Use `percent PERCENT` to specify the percentage of rows to return. `percent` must be a numeric value or an expression that evaluates to a numeric value. If you specify a negative number, `percent` is taken as 0. If `percent` is set to `NULL`, 0 rows are returned. </br>If you do not specify `rowcount` or `percent PERCENT`, one row is returned. |
| ONLY \| WITH TIES | `ONLY` specifies the number of rows or the percentage of rows to return. `WITH TIES` specifies to return other rows that have the same sorting key as the last row obtained. If you use `WITH TIES`, you must specify the `ORDER BY` clause. If you do not specify the `ORDER BY` clause, no other rows will be returned. |
| FOR UPDATE | Imposes an exclusive lock on all the rows in the query results to prevent other concurrent transactions from changing or reading the rows in some transaction isolation levels. <ul><li>`OF column`: instructs the database to lock the rows of a particular table only (the table where the column specified by the `column` keyword is located) in multi-table joins. </li><li> `WAIT`: instructs the database to wait for a period specified by `Integer` before locking the rows in the query result set. If any row in the result set has been locked by another session, the query fails afterward.   </li><li>`NOWAIT`: locks rows in the query result set. If any row in the result set is locked by another session, the query fails afterward. </li><li> `SKIP LOCKED`: skips the rows in the result set that are locked by another session and returns the unlocked rows.  </li></ul><blockquote><b>Note</b></br>`SKIP LOCKED` is not supported in a multi-table `join`.  </blockquote> |
| pivot_clause | Pivots a row to a column.  |
| aggregate_function | The aggregate function.  |
| expr | The expression whose calculation results are constant values.  `pivot_in_clause` supports only constant expressions.  |
| unpivot_clause | Pivots a column to a row.  |

## Examples of queries with Row_Limiting_Clause

### Query data after the Nth row

#### Example 1

Query data after the fourth row 

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tb OFFSET 4 ROW;
+------+------+------+
| ID   | NAME | NUM  |
+------+------+------+
|    5 | b    |  700 |
|    6 | a    |   80 |
+------+------+------+
2 rows in set
```

#### Example 2

Query data after the fifth row 

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tb OFFSET 5 ROWS;
+------+------+------+
| ID   | NAME | NUM  |
+------+------+------+
|    6 | a    |   80 |
+------+------+------+
1 row in set
```

### Query rows with the three smallest IDs

```sql
obclient> SELECT * FROM tb ORDER BY id FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
+------+------+------+
| ID   | NAME | NUM  |
+------+------+------+
|    1 | a    |  100 |
|    2 | b    |  200 |
|    3 | a    |   50 |
+------+------+------+
3 rows in set
```

### Query rows with the two smallest IDs

```sql
obclient> SELECT id, name FROM tb ORDER BY id FETCH NEXT 2 ROWS ONLY;
+------+------+
| ID   | NAME |
+------+------+
|    1 | a    |
|    2 | b    |
+------+------+
2 rows in set
```

### Query the first 30% of data by num

```sql
obclient> SELECT id, name,num FROM tb ORDER BY num
 FETCH FIRST 30 PERCENT ROWS ONLY;
+------+------+------+
| ID   | NAME | NUM  |
+------+------+------+
|    3 | a    |   50 |
+------+------+------+
1 row in set
```

### Query the first 30% of data with the minimum num values and all other data records same as the last data row obtained in the preceding example.

```sql
obclient>  SELECT id, name,num FROM tb ORDER BY num FETCH FIRST 30 PERCENT ROWS WITH TIES;
+------+------+------+
| ID   | NAME | NUM  |
+------+------+------+
|    3 | a    |   50 |
+------+------+------+
1 row in set
```
