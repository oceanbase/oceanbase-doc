# Delete data

After you insert data into a table, you can use the `DELETE` statement or other statements to delete records from the table. This topic describes how to use related statements.

## Prerequisites

Before you delete data, make sure that:

* You have logged on to an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database. For more information, see [Connect to the database](../1.database-connection-of-oracle-mode/1.connection-methods-overview-of-oracle-mode.md).

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
   <h4>Note</h4>
   <p>You can query the <code>oceanbase.DBA_OB_TENANTS</code> view in the sys tenant for the mode of the tenant that you have logged on to.<code></code>  </p>
  </main>

* You have the `DELETE` privilege on the target table. To use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to clear the data in a table, you must also have the `CREATE` privilege on the table. For more information about how to view the privileges of the current user, see [View user privileges](../../../7.reference/2.administrator-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants/9.manage-users-and-permissions/2.oracle-mode/4.view-the-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privileges, request the administrator to grant the privileges. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../../../7.reference/2.administrator-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants/9.manage-users-and-permissions/2.oracle-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-for-oralce-tenant-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Use the DELETE statement to delete data

Generally, the [DELETE](../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/2.dml-of-oracle-mode/1.delete-of-oracle-mode.md) statement is used to delete part of the data or all data from a table.

Syntax:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name [ WHERE condition ];
```

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| table_name | Yes | The table from which data is to be deleted. |
| \[ WHERE condition \] | No | The condition for deleting data. If no condition is specified, all data in the table is deleted.  |

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p> If a table contains hundreds of thousands of records, a large transaction is generated, which may reduce the performance. We recommend that you specify the <code>WHERE</code> clause to delete data in batches or use the <code>TRUNCATE TABLE</code> statement.   </p>
</main>

### Delete part of the data

You can add a `WHERE` condition to the `DELETE` statement to delete the data that meets the condition from a table.

Example 1: Delete all rows whose `value` values are `10004` from the `t_insert` table.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10002 | 31-OCT-22  |
|  2 | US   | 10004 | 31-OCT-22  |
|  3 | UK   | 10004 | 01-NOV-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
3 rows in set

obclient [SYS]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value = 10004;
Query OK, 2 rows affected

obclient [SYS]> SELECT * FROM t_insert;
+----+------+-------+------------+
| ID | NAME | VALUE | GMT_CREATE |
+----+------+-------+------------+
|  1 | CN   | 10002 | 31-OCT-22  |
+----+------+-------+------------+
1 row in set
```

### Delete all data

For a table that contains a small amount of data, you can use the `DELETE` statement to delete all rows from the table.

Example 2: Delete all records from the `t_insert` table.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> DELETE FROM t_insert;
Query OK, 3 row affected
```

For a table that contains millions of records, deleting all the records at a time may result in performance issues. We recommend that you delete the data in batches.

Example 3: First delete the data whose `value` values are smaller than `20000`; then delete the data whose `value` values are smaller than `30000`, and finally delete the data whose `value` values are smaller than `40000`.

```shell
obclient [SYS]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 20000;

obclient [SYS]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 30000;

obclient [SYS]> DELETE FROM t_insert WHERE value < 40000;
```

## Use the TRUNCATE TABLE statement to clear the data from a table

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement clears a table but retains its schema, including the partitions defined for the table. Logically, this statement is equivalent to the `DELETE FROM` statement that is used to delete all rows.

Syntax:

```sql
TRUNCATE [TABLE] table_name;
```

Example 4: Use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement to clear all data from the `ordr` table.

```shell
obclient> TRUNCATE TABLE t_insert;
```

For more information about the `TRUNCATE TABLE` statement, see [TRUNCATE TABLE](../../../7.reference/4.development-reference/1.sql-syntax/3.common-tenant-of-oracle-mode/9.sql-statement-of-oracle-mode/1.ddl-of-oracle-mode/45.truncate-table-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Use DBLink to delete data

The current OceanBase Database version allows you to use DBLink to delete data from OceanBase Database in Oracle mode and Oracle databases.

Example: Use DBLink to delete the rows whose `C2` column value is `7` from the `t5` table in the remote database.

```shell
obclient> SET ob_trx_timeout = 1000000000;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t5@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    7 |    7 |
|    8 |    8 |
+------+------+
2 row in set

obclient> DELETE FROM t5@orcl_dblink WHERE C2 = 7;
Query OK, 1 row affected

obclient> commit;
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> SELECT * FROM t5@orcl_dblink;
+------+------+
| C1   | C2   |
+------+------+
|    8 |    8 |
+------+------+
1 row in set
```
