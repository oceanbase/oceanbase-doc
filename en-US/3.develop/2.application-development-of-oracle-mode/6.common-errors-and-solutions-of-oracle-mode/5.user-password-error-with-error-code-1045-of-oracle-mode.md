# Incorrect user password, with ERROR 1045 reported

This topic describes how to handle `ERROR 1045`, where an incorrect password is entered for logon in OceanBase Database in Oracle mode. 

## Symptom

The system reports an error when you enter an incorrect password for logon. 

```sql
[admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
$obclient -h10.0.0.0 -P2881 -uny@Oracle -p -A
Enter password:
ERROR 1045 (42000): Access denied for user 'NY'@'xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx' (using password: YES)
```

## Troubleshooting procedure

Take the following steps to change the password for a user and log on again. 

1. Log on to the tenant as the administrator. The default administrator username of an Oracle tenant is `SYS`. 

   > **Note**
   >
   > If you log on as the administrator, you can directly unlock users. If you log on as a regular user, you must have the global `ALTER USER` privilege to unlock users. 

   ```sql
   [admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
   $obclient -hxx.xx.xx.1 -P2881 -usys@Oracle -p -A
   Enter password:

2. Change the password of the `ny` user. 

   ```sql
    obclient [SYS]> ALTER USER ny IDENTIFIED BY ***3***;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```

   > **Note**
   >
   > When you set the password for a user, the password must meet the password complexity requirements of the current tenant. For more information about password complexity, see [Set password complexity rules](../../../7.reference/2.manage-guide/2.basic-database-management/4.manage-tenants-1/5.manage-users-and-permissions/2.oracle-3/2.set-password-complexity.md). 

3. Log on as the `ny` user again. 

   ```sql
   [admin@k08j13249.eu95sqa /home/admin]
   $obclient -hxx.xx.xx.1 -P2881 -uny@Oracle -p -A
