# Use Canal to synchronize MySQL data to OceanBase Database in real time

`Canal` is an open-source product of Alibaba. It parses incremental logs in MySQL databases and thereby provides incremental data subscription and consumption. The open-source project is available at <https://github.com/alibaba/canal>.

## Architecture

`Canal` works with the following four components:

* `Canal Deployer`: the `Canal` component that serves as a server and converts `binlogs` to `CanalEntry` data.

* `Canal Admin`: the configuration administrator of `Canal`. It provides a web page for you to manage the `Canal` `Deployer`.

* `Canal Adapter`: the client adapter of `Canal`. It parses the `CanalEntry` data and synchronizes the incremental changes to the destination database.

* `Canal Example`: the `client` example of `Canal`. You can modify the sample code as needed to implement your consumption logic.

![Canal](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8420219361/p366248.png)

In the above figure, `canal-admin` is for deployment and is optional, `canal-server` is the `Canal Deployer` software, and `adapter` is the `Canal Adapter` software. The source database is a MariaDB`` database and the destination database is a MySQL tenant in OceanBase Database.

### Canal Deployer

In OceanBase Database, `Canal Deployer` provides services by using Canal `servers `and `instances`. A Canal `server` is a deployer service that can have multiple `instances`, and an `instance` represents a data synchronization channel.``````

A `canal instance` is created by `Spring` during operation. The configuration information of the `Canal instance` is specified in the `canal.properties` file in the conf/ directory of the Canal Deployer. `Canal` provides several configuration files that are stored in the `conf/spring` directory. You can directly use these configuration files.

After a `Canal instance` parses binlogs into the CanalEntry data, it stores the `CanalEntry` data in the memory for later consumption. Canal provides two data consumption modes:

* TCP mode: The destination database directly connects to Canal for data consumption.

* MQ mode: The data in the Canal memory is written to a message queue (MQ), and the destination database connects to the MQ by using a client for data consumption.

Canal provides two types of position information. One is the parsing position, which is recorded during the conversion of a log into an `entry` and managed by `LogPositionManager`. The other is the client consumption position, which is managed by `MetaManager`. These two types of position information are also specified in the `spring xml` file of the `Canal instance`.

### Canal Adapter

`Canal Adapter` consumes the `CanalEntry` data and writes it to the corresponding destination container. Similar to `Canal Deployer`, `Canal Adapter` also provides `instances`. `Canal Adapter` is started by the `Adapter launcher` and generates `instances` based on the configurations that you specified. The instances read the `CanalEntry``` data and write it to the destination database.

### Canal Admin

`Canal Admin` is a service platform that simplifies the deployment of Canal. Both `Canal servers` and `instances` support standalone deployment and high-availability cluster deployment. `Canal Admin````` allows you to easily manage their deployment on a web page.

## Deployment example

### Prepare a MySQL database

``MariaDB is used here.

```bash
yum install mariadb mariadb-server
```

You must first enable Binlog writing and set the `binlog-format` parameter to ROW. The following example shows you how to configure the `my.cnf` file in the `/etc` directory:

```bash
[mysqld]
log-bin=mysql-bin # Enable the Binlog.
binlog-format=ROW # Set the binlog format to ROW.
server_id=1 # The server ID must be defined for the configuration of MySQL replication. It must be different from the slaveId of Canal.
```

Run the following commands to grant the `MySQL slave` privileges to the Canal user for connection with the MySQL database. If you already have a Canal user, directly run the `grant` command.

```bash
CREATE USER canal IDENTIFIED BY 'canal';
GRANT SELECT, REPLICATION SLAVE, REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'canal'@'%';
-- GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'canal'@'%' ;
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

Then a business database is initialized for TPC-H benchmark tests, which will be described in detail in Chapter 6).

### Deploy Canal Admin

Using Canal Admin to deploy Canal Deployer is easier, but it is not mandatory.

Canal Admin is used here.

* Download Canal Admin at <https://github.com/alibaba/canal/releases>.

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/alibaba/canal/releases/download/canal-1.1.5/canal.admin-1.1.5.tar.gz
   ```

* Run the following command to extract files to the specified directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/canal-admin && tar zxvf canal.admin-1.1.5.tar.gz -C ~/canal-admin/
   ```

* Modify the configuration file.

   ```bash
   cd ~/canal-admin && vim conf/application.yml
   ```

   The following example shows how to modify the configuration file:

   ```yaml
   server:
     port: 8089
   spring:
     jackson:
       date-format: yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
       time-zone: GMT+8
   spring.datasource:
     address: 127.0.0.1:3306
     database: canal_manager
     username: canal
     password: canal
     driver-class-name: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
     url: jdbc:mysql://${spring.datasource.address}/${spring.datasource.database}?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&useSSL=false
     hikari:
       maximum-pool-size: 30
       minimum-idle: 1
   canal:
     adminUser: admin
     adminPasswd: ******
   ```

   To avoid connection failure caused by an incorrect password, we do not recommend that you change the password in the `adminPasswd` field during the first test.

* Run the following command to initialize the MetaDB:

   ```sql
   mysql -h127.1 -uroot -P3306 -p
   source conf/canal_manager.sql
   ```

   The related tables are automatically created based on the script:

   ```sql
   show tables;
   MariaDB [tpch]> use canal_manager;
   Database changed
   MariaDB [canal_manager]> show tables;
   +-------------------------+
   | Tables_in_canal_manager |
   +-------------------------+
   | canal_adapter_config    |
   | canal_cluster           |
   | canal_config            |
   | canal_instance_config   |
   | canal_node_server       |
   | canal_user              |
   +-------------------------+
   6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

* Run the following command to start the web service:

   ```bash
   cd ~/canal-admin && bin/startup.sh
   ```

   In general cases, if the web service is started, port 8089 is listened to.

   ```bash
   [root@obce00 adapter]# netstat -ntlp |grep 15973
   tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:8089            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      15973/java
   ```

   If any problem occurs during the startup, check the logs.

   ```bash
   vim logs/admin.log +
   ```

* Log on to the web UI of Canal Admin.

   Access webpage of Canal Admin: <http://127.0.0.1:8089/>

   Username for logon: `admin`

   Password for logon: `******`

### Deploy Canal Deployer

* Download Canal at <https://github.com/alibaba/canal/releases>.

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/alibaba/canal/releases/download/canal-1.1.5/canal.deployer-1.1.5.tar.gz
   ```

* Run the following command to extract files to the specified directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/canal && tar zxvf canal.deployer-1.1.5.tar.gz  -C ~/canal
   ```

* Modify configurations.

   If you do not use Canal Admin to deploy the Canal server and instances, use the default configuration files `conf/canal.properties` and `conf/example/instance.properties`. These configuration files are provided to create a default instance named `example`. You need to modify the database connection address, username, and password of the `example` instance. The following sample code shows you how to modify the configuration file:

   ```bash
   vi conf/example/instance.properties

   # mysql serverId
   canal.instance.mysql.slaveId = 1234
   # Specify the position information of your database.
   canal.instance.master.address = 127.0.0.1:3306
   canal.instance.master.journal.name =
   canal.instance.master.position =
   canal.instance.master.timestamp =
   #canal.instance.standby.address =
   #canal.instance.standby.journal.name =
   #canal.instance.standby.position =
   #canal.instance.standby.timestamp =
   # Specify the username and password of your database.
   canal.instance.dbUsername = canal
   canal.instance.dbPassword = canal
   canal.instance.defaultDatabaseName =
   canal.instance.connectionCharset = UTF-8
   #table regex
   canal.instance.filter.regex = .*\\..*
   ```

   The `canal.instance.connectionCharset` parameter specifies the java encoding type corresponding to the database encoding method. Valid values: `UTF-8`, `GBK`, and `ISO-8859-1`. If the system has only one CPU core, set the `canal.instance.parser.parallel` parameter to `false`.

   If you use Canal Admin to deploy Canal `servers` and `instances`, you must replace the content in the `conf/canal.properties` configuration file with the content in the `conf/canal_local.properties` configuration file and then modify the `manager` address in the `conf/canal.properties` file. You can retain the default values for other parameters.

   ```bash
   [root@obce00 canal]# cat conf/canal.properties
   # register ip
   canal.register.ip =
   # canal admin config
   canal.admin.manager = 127.0.0.1:8089
   canal.admin.port = 11110
   canal.admin.user = admin
   canal.admin.passwd = 4ACFE3202A5FF5CF467898FC58AAB1D615029441
   # admin auto register
   canal.admin.register.auto = true
   canal.admin.register.cluster =
   canal.admin.register.name =
   ```

   > **Note**
   > The value of the `passwd` parameter is cyphertext of `admin` in the MySQL database. The password must be the same as the one specified in the Canal Admin configuration file. If you have changed the password in the Canal Admin configuration file, you must change this password accordingly. To obtain the cyphertext, run the following `select password` command in MySQL:

   ```sql
   MariaDB [canal_manager]> select password('admin');
   +-------------------------------------------+
   | password('admin')                         |
   +-------------------------------------------+
   | *4ACFE3202A5FF5CF467898FC58AAB1D615029441 |
   +-------------------------------------------+
   1 row in set (0.00 sec)
   ```

* Start Canal Server

   Regardless of the deployment method you choose, you can run the following command to start Canal Server after you modify the configuration files:

   ```bash
   sh bin/startup.sh
   ```

* (Optional) Use Canal Admin to deploy the Canal server and Canal instance

   To use Canal Admin to manage Canal servers, log on to the Canal Admin console at <http://172.24.50.39:8089/#/canalServer/nodeServers>. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Canal Server** \> **Server Management**. Then, click **Create Server**.

   > **Note**
   >
   > The IP address in the preceding link is the IP address of the server where Canal Admin is deployed. Replace it with the actual IP address of the server where Canal Admin is deployed.

   ![Server Management](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8420219361/p367320.jpg)

   In the **New Server Information** dialog box, click **OK**.

   In the left-side navigation pane, choose **Canal Server** \> **Instance Management**, and then click **Create Instance** on the **Instance Management** page.

   ![Create Instance](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8420219361/p367326.jpg)

   On the **New Instance Configuration** page, click **Load Template**. The instance configuration file appears, which is similar to the one described in the Deploy Canal Deployer section. You need to modify configurations related to `Canal` and the source database in the configuration file.

   ![Load Template](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8420219361/p367355.jpg)

   Click **Save** and name the instance as `mariadb`.

   The status of the new instance is **Stopped**. You can click **Start** in the **Actions** column to start the instance. After the instance is started, the status changes to **Started**.

   ![Start Instance](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/8420219361/p367338.jpg)

* View server logs

   You can view the `server` logs either in `Canal Admin` or in the CLI by running the following command:

   ```bash
   vi logs/canal/canal.log
   ```

* View instance logs

   You can view the `instance` logs either in `Canal Admin` or in the CLI by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   tail -f logs/canal/canal.log
   tail -f logs/example/example.log
   tail -f logs/mariadb/mariadb.log
   ```

* Run the following command to stop the service:

   ```bash
   sh bin/stop.sh
   ```

## Deploy the RDB adapter

Canal Adapter supports multiple containers. For OceanBase Community Edition, the Canal Adapter uses the `RDB` module. The destination container can be a MySQL database or an OceanBase Community Edition database. In this example, the destination container is an OceanBase database.

You need to perform the following steps to manually deploy Canal Adapter:

* Download the Canal Adapter at <https://github.com/alibaba/canal/releases>.

   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/alibaba/canal/releases/download/canal-1.1.5/canal.adapter-1.1.5.tar.gz
   ```

* Run the following command to extract files to the specified directory:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/adapter && tar zxvf canal.adapter-1.1.5.tar.gz -C ~/adapter/
   ```

* Modify the configuration file `application.yml` of the launcher under the `conf` directory.

   Set `mode` of the adapter source to `tcp`. Specify the `canal.tcp` properties, including the IP address and port of the canal server and the username and password for database connection. Then, specify the connection information of the adapter destination. `instance` is the source instance name, which is defined when Canal is deployed.

   > **Note**
   > If you did not use Canal Admin for deployment, the instance name would be `example`. If you used Canal Admin for deployment, the `instance` name would be the one that you specified, for example, `mariadb` in the preceding example.

   `key` is a custom parameter. The value will be used later. `jdbc` properties specify the information used to connect to the destination OceanBase database. You can use the MySQL driver.

   ```bash
   mode: tcp #tcp kafka rocketMQ rabbitMQ
     flatMessage: true
     zookeeperHosts:
     syncBatchSize: 1000
     retries: 0
     timeout:
     accessKey:
     secretKey:
     consumerProperties:
      # canal tcp consumer
       canal.tcp.server.host: 127.0.0.1:11111
       canal.tcp.zookeeper.hosts:
       canal.tcp.batch.size: 500
       canal.tcp.username: tpch
       canal.tcp.password: Dg0g*****
     canalAdapters:
     - instance: mariadb # canal instance Name or mq topic name
       groups:
       - groupId: g1
         outerAdapters:
       - name: logger
         - name: rdb
           key: obmysql
           properties:
             jdbc.driverClassName: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
             jdbc.url: jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1:2883/tpch?useUnicode=true
             jdbc.username: tpch@obmysql#obdemo
             jdbc.password: Dg0g*****
   ```

* Modify the RDB mapping file.

   You need to modify the `mytest_user.yml` file in the `conf/rdb/` directory.

   The mapping modes include table mapping and full-database mapping. The following example shows how to configure full-database mapping.

   ```bash
   [root@obce00 adapter]# cat conf/rdb/mytest_user.yml
   #dataSourceKey: defaultDS
   #destination: example
   #groupId: g1
   #outerAdapterKey: mysql1
   #concurrent: true
   #dbMapping:
   #  database: mytest
   #  table: user
   #  targetTable: mytest
   #  targetPk:
   #    id: id
   ##  mapAll: true
   #  targetColumns:
   #    id:
   #    name:
   #    role_id:
   #    c_time:
   #    test1:
   #  etlCondition: "where c_time>={}"
   #  commitBatch: 3000 # The size of batch commit.
   # Mirror schema synchronize config
   dataSourceKey: defaultDS
   destination: mariadb
   groupId: g1
   outerAdapterKey: obmysql
   concurrent: true
   dbMapping:
     mirrorDb: true
     database: tpch
     commitBatch: 1000
   ```

   The `destination` parameter specifies the name of the `Canal instance`. The `outerAdapterKey` parameter is the user-defined `key`. The `mirrorDb` parameter specifies to mirror the database-level DDL and DML operations of the source database to the destination database.

   The type of imported data depends on the metatype of the destination table. Data types are automatically converted.

* Start RDB.

   If you use the driver of OceanBase Database for the destination database, place the driver package in the `lib` folder.

   Run the following command to start the canal-adapter launcher:

   ```bash
   bin/startup.sh
   ```

   Modify the data of the `mysql mytest.user` table to verify the configuration. The modification will be automatically synchronized to the `MYTEST.TB_USER` table of the MySQL database. The logs of DML operations will be displayed.

* Run the following command to stop RDB:

   ```bash
   bin/stop.sh
   ```

* Run the following command to view RDB logs:

   ```bash
   tail -f logs/adapter/adapter.log
   2021-12-09 09:56:04.148 [pool-6-thread-1] DEBUG c.a.o.canal.client.adapter.rdb.service.RdbSyncService - DML: {"data":{"s_suppkey":99995,"s_name":null,"s_address":null,"s_nationkey":null,"s_phone":null,"s_acctbal":null,"s_comment":null},"database":"tpch","destination":"mariadb","old":null,"table":"supplier2","type":"INSERT"}

   ```

## Perform synchronization tests

You can perform DML and DDL operations in the source MySQL database named `tpch`, and check whether the modifications can be synchronized to the destination database. Note the following synchronization restrictions:

* The source table must have a primary key. Otherwise, when a record is deleted from the source table, synchronizing the operation to the destination will delete the entire table in the destination.

* The CREATE TABLE and CREATE COLUMN DDL operations can be synchronized. However, due to the restrictions on the MySQL tenant in OceanBase Database, a primary key added after a table is created or the change of the column type, such as change between the Numeric, String, and Datetime types, cannot be synchronized.
