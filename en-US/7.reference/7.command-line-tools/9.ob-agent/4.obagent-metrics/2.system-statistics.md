# System statistics

This topic describes the general statistical events. 

You can use an SQL statement to display all statistical events and their types in alphabetical order in the sys tenant. Sample code:

```sql
obclient> SELECT name,class FROM v$statname ORDER BY name;
```

For more information about the v$statname view, see [v$statname](../../../../7.reference/5.system-reference/4.system-view-of-mysql-mode/3.performance-view-of-mysql-mode/56.v-statname-of-mysql-mode.md).
