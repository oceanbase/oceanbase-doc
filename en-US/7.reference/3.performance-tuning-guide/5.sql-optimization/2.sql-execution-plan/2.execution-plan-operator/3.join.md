# JOIN

`JOIN` operators join data in two tables based on specified conditions.

`JOIN` operations are classified into three types: INNER JOIN, OUTER JOIN, and SEMI/ANTI JOIN.

OceanBase Database supports the following `JOIN` operators: `NESTED LOOP JOIN (NLJ)`, `MERGE JOIN (MJ)`, and `HASH JOIN (HJ)`.

## NLJ

In the following example, queries Q1 and Q2 use NLJ based on the hint. Operator 0 is an NLJ operator and has two subnodes: operators 1 and 2. Execution logic of this operator:

1. Run the No. 1 operator to read a row.

2. Run the No. 2 operator to read all rows.

3. Join the result sets of the No. 1 and No. 2 operators, and apply the filter condition to export the results.

4. Repeat Step 1 until the No. 1 operator stops iteration.


```sql
obclient> CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INT, c2 INT);
Query OK, 0 rows affected

obclient> CREATE TABLE t2 (d1 INT, d2 INT, PRIMARY KEY (d1));
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Q1:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_NL(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c2 = d2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************

  2 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

The `MATERIAL` operator materializes the data output of subsequent operators. For more information, see [MATERIAL](../2.execution-plan-operator/10.MATERIAL.md).

```sql
Q2:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_NL(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c1 = d1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| ==========================================
|ID|OPERATOR        |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST |
------------------------------------------
|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN|    |990      |37346|
|1 | TABLE SCAN     |T1  |999      |669  |
|2 | TABLE GET      |T2  |1        |36   |
==========================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      conds(nil), nl_params_([T1.C1])
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `NLJ` operator.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|------------|------------------|
| output | The output expression of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the NLJ operator.  |
| conds | The join conditions.  For example, the join condition in example 1 is `t1.c2 = t2.d2`.  |
| nl_params_ | The pushdown parameters generated based on the data of the table on the left of the NLJ operator.  For example, the pushdown parameter in example 2 is `t1.c1`.  For the iteration of each row of the table on the left, NLJ creates a parameter based on `nl_params` and, based on this parameter and the original join condition `c1= d1`, creates a filter condition applicable to the table on the right: `d1 = ?`.  The filter condition is pushed down to the table on the right, extracting the query range of the index. The query range is the range of data to be scanned. In query Q2, the No. 2 operator is a `TABLE GET` operator because of the pushdown condition `d1=?`.  |

In the following example, no JOIN condition is specified in query Q3. The No. 0 operator is displayed as a `NESTED-LOOP JOIN CARTESIAN`, which is logically an NLJ operator with no JOIN conditions.

```sql
Q3:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| =====================================================
|ID|OPERATOR                  |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST  |
-----------------------------------------------------
|0 |NESTED-LOOP JOIN CARTESIAN|    |998001   |747480|
|1 | TABLE SCAN               |T1  |999      |647   |
|2 | MATERIAL                 |    |999      |1519  |
|3 |  TABLE SCAN              |T2  |999      |647   |
=====================================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      conds(nil), nl_params_(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil)
  3 - output([T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

## MERGE JOIN (MJ)

In the following example, query Q4 uses MJ by adding the hint `USE_MERGE`. Operator 0 is an MJ operator and has two subnodes: operators 1 and 3. The operator merges data of the left and right subnodes, and therefore requires that the data of the two subnodes be ordered in relation to the JOIN column.

Take query Q4 as an example. The JOIN condition is `t1.c2 = t2.d2`, which means sorting data of `t1` by `c2`, and data of `t2` by `d2`. In query Q4, the output of the No. 2 operator is unordered, and the output of the No. 4 operator is sorted by `d2`. Both of them do not meet the requirement of MJ. Therefore, the No. 1 and No. 3 operators are assigned for sorting.

```sql
Q4:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_MERGE(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c2 = d2 AND c1 + d1 > 10\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| ======================================
|ID|OPERATOR    |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST |
--------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE JOIN  |    |3261     |14199|
|1 | SORT       |    |999      |4505 |
|2 |  TABLE SCAN|T1  |999      |669  |
|3 | SORT       |    |999      |4483 |
|4 |  TABLE SCAN|T2  |999      |647  |
======================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([T1.C2 = T2.D2]), other_conds([T1.C1 + T2.D1 > 10])
  1 - output([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C2, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), partitions(p0)
  3 - output([T2.D2], [T2.D1]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T2.D2, ASC])
  4 - output([T2.D2], [T2.D1]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D2], [T2.D1]), partitions(p0)
```

In the following example, the JOIN condition in query Q5 is `t1.c1 = t2.d1`, which means sorting data of `t1` by `c1`, and data of `t2` by `d1`. In this execution plan, the primary table scan is performed for `t2`, and the results are sorted by `d1`. Therefore, it is unnecessary to assign an additional `SORT` operator. Ideally, proper indexes are selected for tables on the left and right of the `join`, and the data order specified by the indexes can meet the requirements of MJ. In this case, no `SORT` operator is needed.

```sql
Q5:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_MERGE(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2 WHERE c1 = d1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| =====================================
|ID|OPERATOR    |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
-------------------------------------
|0 |MERGE JOIN  |    |990      |6096|
|1 | SORT       |    |999      |4505|
|2 |  TABLE SCAN|T1  |999      |669 |
|3 | TABLE SCAN |T2  |999      |647 |
=====================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([T1.C1 = T2.D1]), other_conds(nil)
  1 - output([T1.C2], [T1.C1]), filter(nil), sort_keys([T1.C1, ASC])
  2 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  3 - output([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `MJ` operator.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expression of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the MJ operator.  |
| equal_conds | Equivalent join conditions for MJ. The result sets of the subnodes on the left and right must be ordered in relation to the JOIN column.  |
| other_conds | Other JOIN conditions.  For example, Q4 has an additional condition: `t1.c1 + t2.d1 > 10`.  |

## HASH JOIN (HJ)

In the following example, query Q6 uses HJ based on the `USE_HASH` hint. Operator 0 is an HJ operator and has two subnodes: operators 1 and 2. Execution logic of this operator:

1. Read data from the subnode on the left to generate a hash value based on the JOIN column, such as`t1.c1`, and then create a hash table.

2. Read data from the subnode on the right to generate a hash value based on the JOIN column, such as`t2.d1`, and try to join with the data of `t1` in the corresponding hash table.

```sql
Q6:
obclient> EXPLAIN SELECT /*+USE_HASH(t1, t2)*/ t1.c2 + t2.d2 FROM t1, t2
      WHERE c1 = d1 AND c2 + d2 > 1\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
Query Plan:
| ====================================
|ID|OPERATOR   |NAME|EST. ROWS|COST|
------------------------------------
|0 |HASH JOIN  |    |330      |4850|
|1 | TABLE SCAN|T1  |999      |669 |
|2 | TABLE SCAN|T2  |999      |647 |
====================================
Outputs & filters:
-------------------------------------
  0 - output([T1.C2 + T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      equal_conds([T1.C1 = T2.D1]), other_conds([T1.C2 + T2.D2 > 1])
  1 - output([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), filter(nil),
      access([T1.C1], [T1.C2]), partitions(p0)
  2 - output([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), filter(nil),
      access([T2.D1], [T2.D2]), partitions(p0)
```

In the preceding example, the `outputs & filters` section in the execution plan display shows in detail the output information of the `HJ` operator.

| **Parameter** | **Description** |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| output | The output expression of the operator.  |
| filter | The filter conditions of the operator.  In this example, `filter` is set to `nil` because no filter condition is configured for the HJ operator.  |
| equal_conds | The equivalent join. The JOIN columns on the left and right sides are used to calculate the hash value.  |
| other_conds | Other JOIN conditions.  For example, Q6 has an additional join condition: `t1.c2 + t2.d2 > 1`.  |
