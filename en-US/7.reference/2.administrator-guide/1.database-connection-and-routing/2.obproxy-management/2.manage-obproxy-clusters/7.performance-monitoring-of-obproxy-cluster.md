# Monitor ODP cluster performance

This topic describes how to view the performance monitoring data of an ODP cluster in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), including the service monitoring information and system monitoring information.

## Service monitoring

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the ODP cluster whose performance data you want to view. Then, go to the **Service Monitoring** tab on the **Performance Monitoring** page.

   * On the **Service Monitoring** tab, you can set **Stat Period** to **Minute** or **10 Seconds**. You can also select **Last 30 Minutes**, **Last 1 Hour**, or **Custom Time**.

4. You can view the performance monitoring data of the ODP cluster in the **Overview** section. Click **View All** in the upper-right corner to view the number of transactions per second, number of requests, number of connected clients, number of connected servers, SQL processing time, number of error response packets per second, routing table****, and number of network request bytes****.************************

5. In the **Connected OceanBase Cluster Data** section, view the performance of interaction between the current ODP cluster and OceanBase clusters that use the ODP cluster.

   As for each performance monitoring metric, you can view its maximum, minimum, and average values. You can click Column Management to select the metrics to display. The metrics include transaction count per second, requests, connected clients, connected servers, SQL processing time, error response packets per second, routing table********, and network request bytes****.********************

6. In the **OceanBase IP Address** section, view the performance of each ODP node in the current ODP cluster.

   As for each performance monitoring metric, you can view its maximum, minimum, and average values. You can click Column Management to select the metrics to display. The metrics include transaction count per second, requests, connected clients, connected servers, SQL processing time, error response packets per second, routing table********, and network request bytes****.********************

## System monitoring

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **OBProxy**.

3. In the ODP cluster list, click the ODP cluster whose performance data you want to view. Then, go to the **System Monitoring** tab on the **Performance Monitoring** page.

   On the **System Monitoring** tab, you can set **Stat Period** to **Minute** or **10 Seconds**. You can also select **Last 30 Minutes**, **Last 1 Hour**, or **Custom Time**.
