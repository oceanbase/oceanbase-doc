# MySQL tenants

This topic describes the users and their roles under a MySQL tenant other than the sys tenant.

Users under MySQL tenants include tenant administrators and regular users.

## Tenant administrator

The built-in `root` user under each MySQL tenant in OceanBase Database acts as the tenant administrator. Tenant administrators in OceanBase Database can configure database parameters, create database objects, and allocate access privileges under the corresponding tenants.

## Users

Regular users must be granted the required access and operation privileges before they can access and manage database objects under the corresponding tenants. Regular users are usually created and granted privileges by the tenant administrator. For more information about how to create and grant privileges to a user, see [Create a user](../3.mysql-mode/1.create-user-of-mysql-mode.md) and [Modify user privileges](../3.mysql-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-of-mysql-mode.md).
