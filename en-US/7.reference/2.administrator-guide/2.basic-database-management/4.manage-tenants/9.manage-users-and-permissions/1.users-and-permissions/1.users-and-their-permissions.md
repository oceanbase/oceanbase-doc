# Overview

This topic describes the privileges of users under MySQL and Oracle tenants.

  </main>

OceanBase Database users are classified into two categories: users under the sys tenant and users under a user tenant. User tenants can be in Oracle or MySQL mode, which are respectively referred to as Oracle tenants and MySQL tenants. When you create a user, if the current session is under the sys tenant, the created user is a user under the sys tenant. Otherwise, the user is a user under a user tenant. Different tenants have independent user privileges.

## Privileges of users under MySQL tenants

Users under a MySQL tenant of OceanBase Database have access only to the objects under the tenant, and the privileges for the users are compatible with those in MySQL.

OceanBase Database in MySQL mode supports three types of privileges:

* User-level privileges

   User-level privileges are global privileges that apply to all databases.

* Database-level privileges

   Database-level privileges apply to a specific database and all its objects.

* Object privileges

   Object privileges apply to objects of the specified type in all databases. These privileges can be applied to the specified objects in the databases, all objects of the specified type in the databases (for example, all tables in the databases), or all database objects (for example, tables, indexes, and views).

The following table lists the privileges in OceanBase Database in MySQL mode.

## Privileges of users under Oracle tenants

Users under an Oracle tenant of OceanBase Database have access only to objects under the tenant, and the privileges for the users are compatible with those in Oracle.

OceanBase Database in Oracle mode supports two types of privileges:

* System privileges

   System privileges allow users to perform standard administrator tasks in the database. If you want to perform operations on schema objects, you must have the required system privileges. System privileges are very powerful. We recommend that they be granted only to trusted users.

* Object privileges

   Object privileges allow you to perform specific operations on specified objects.

The following table lists available privileges in OceanBase Database in Oracle mode.
