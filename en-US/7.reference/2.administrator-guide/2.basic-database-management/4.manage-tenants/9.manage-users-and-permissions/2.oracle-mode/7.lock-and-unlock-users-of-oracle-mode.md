# Lock and unlock a user

You can lock a user that does not need to access OceanBase Database. The locked user cannot log on to OceanBase Database. You can unlock the user as an administrator.

## Prerequisites

If you log on as the administrator, you can directly lock and unlock users. If you log on as a regular user, you must have the global `ALTER USER` privilege to lock and unlock users. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../2.oracle-mode/4.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the required privileges, contact the administrator to obtain the privileges. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../2.oracle-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md).

## Procedure

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute the following statement to lock or unlock a user.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER user_name ACCOUNT LOCK | UNLOCK;
   ```

   Examples:

   * Lock a user

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER USER demo ACCOUNT LOCK ;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient -udemo@demo0_111 -P2881 -h10.10.10.1   -p******
      obclient: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
      ERROR 3118 (HY000): User locked
      ```

   * Unlock a user

      ```sql
      obclient> ALTER USER demo ACCOUNT UNLOCK ;
      Query OK, 0 rows affected

      obclient -udemo@demo0_111 -P2881 -h10.10.10.1 -p -A
      Enter password:
      Welcome to the OceanBase.  Commands end with ; or \g.
      Your OceanBase connection id is 3221584177
      Server version: OceanBase 4.0.0.0 (r100000172022101218-6ab80a3950710941946c004d805fcfded7a4aa2c) (Built Oct 12 2022 18:43:39)

      Copyright (c) 2000, 2018, OceanBase Corporation Ab and others.

      Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.
      ```

3. After you lock or unlock a user, you can query the `is_locked` field in the `ALL_VIRTUAL_USER_REAL_AGENT` table to check the locking status of the user.

   Sample code:

   ```sql
   obclient> SELECT user_name,is_locked FROM ALL_VIRTUAL_USER_REAL_AGENT WHERE user_name='DEMO';
   +-----------+-----------+
   | USER_NAME | IS_LOCKED |
   +-----------+-----------+
   | DEMO      |         1 |
   +-----------+-----------+
   1 row in set
   ```

   If the value of the `is_locked` field is `1`, the user is locked. If the value of the `is_locked` field is `0`, the user is unlocked.
