# Drop a user

You can drop a user by using the `DROP USER` statement.

## Prerequisites

You must have the `DROP USER` system privilege to execute the `DROP USER` statement. For information about how to view your privileges, see [View user privileges](../2.oracle-mode/4.view-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md). If you do not have the `DROP USER` privilege, request the administrator to grant you the privilege. For more information, see [Modify user privileges](../2.oracle-mode/5.modify-user-permissions-of-oracle-mode.md).

<h4>Notice</h4>
<p>Dropping a user also drops all objects owned by the user, for example, privileges, databases, and tables. Proceed with caution. </p>
</main>

## Procedure

1. Log on to an Oracle tenant of the cluster.

2. Execute any of the following statements to drop a user.

   Sample statement:

   ```sql
   DROP USER username CASCADE;
   ```

   Notes:

   * `CASCADE` specifies that the system will drop all objects owned by the user, such as privileges, databases, and tables, before it drops the user.

   * `username` specifies the user to be dropped. Only a single user can be dropped at a time.

   Example: Drop the `sqluser` user.

   ```shell
   obclient> DROP USER sqluser CASCADE;
   Query OK, 0 rows affected
   ```
