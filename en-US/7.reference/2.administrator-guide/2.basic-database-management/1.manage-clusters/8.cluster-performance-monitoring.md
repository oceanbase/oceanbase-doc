# Monitor cluster performance

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) allows the administrator to view performance metrics of clusters in different dimensions.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the **Clusters** list, find the target cluster and click its name.

3. In the left-side navigation pane on the page that appears, click **Performance Monitoring**.

4. In the **Data Filtering** section, select filter conditions.

   The following table describes the filter conditions.

   | **Condition** | **Description** |

   * Click the **Database Performance** tab to view the database performance.

      To display other metrics, click **Select Metric** on the right side and select the metrics that you want to display. The system can display up to 10 metrics.
