# Configure an alert channel

After you configure an alert channel in OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP), you can receive alert notifications through the configured channel.

## Prerequisites

The logged-on user has administrator permissions.

## Background

Alerting is a standalone feature. If you do not configure alert channels, you can view alerts only on the **Alert Events** page of the OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) console. You can configure alert channels to receive alert notifications.

The alert channel allows OCP to send notifications and supports the following channel types:

* DingTalk

* Feishu

* WeChat Enterprise

* Email

* HTTP

* Custom script

<main id="notice" type='explain'>
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>You can configure the time variables for alert aggregation when you configure a channel. After an alert channel is updated, the channel restarts alert aggregation. If a valid alert item exists, you may receive alert notifications faster. </p>
  </main>

OCP provides a default alert channel. You need to configure it before use and you cannot delete it.

## Procedure

This topic describes how to configure an alert channel. For more information about the configuration samples, see User Guide of the required OCP version.

1. Log on to the OCP console.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, choose **System Management** > **Alerts**.

3. On the **Alert Channels** tab, click **Create Channel**.

4. Configure the basic information of the channel as prompted.

   The fields to be specified vary with the channel type.

   | Parameter | Description |
   |-----------|------------------------------|
   | Proxy | Specify the proxy server that sends alerts, in the format of `http:ip:port`. In the format, `ip` represents the IP address of the proxy server, and `port` represents the port that is assigned to send alerts.  For example, if the IP address of the proxy server is `xx.xx.xx.xx` and Port 80 is assigned, you can set this parameter to `http:xx.xx.xx.xx:80`. |
   | Request Method | Select the request method as needed.  |
   | URL Template | Enter the URL for sending alert information.  |
   | Header Template | Enter the template for HTTP headers. Separate multiple parameters with line breaks, for example: `Content-Type:application/json x-lt-openKey:diskJitterAlarm charset:utf-8`. |
   | Body Template | Enter the template for the notification content.  |
   | Response Verification Information | Optional. <ul><li>Responses vary with channels. You must configure the response verification information for OCP to accurately determine whether a message is successfully sent. </li><li>You must enter the response verification information as a JSON string. OCP will parse the fields in the JSON string and match them with the corresponding information in the body of the channel response. If all fields are successfully matched, OCP determines that the alert message is successfully sent. </li><li>If you are not sure of the channel response, you can set it to {}. In this way, OCP will always assume that the messages are successfully sent. </li></ul> |
