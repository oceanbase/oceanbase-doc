# SQL monitoring

OceanBase Cloud Platform (OCP) provides SQL monitoring features for suspicious SQL statements, TopSQL statements, SlowSQL statements, and ParallelSQL statements.

<main id="notice" type=''>
<h4>Applicability</h4>
<p>At present, OCP Community Edition does not support diagnostics of suspicious SQL statements and Parallel SQL statements. </p>
</main>

## Background

Suspicious SQL statements, TopSQL statements, SlowSQL statements, and ParallelSQL statements are described as follows:

* Suspicious SQL statements: SQL statements that meet the diagnostic characteristics after a diagnosis based on the diagnosis type, SQL statement, execution history, and table structure.

* TopSQL statements: SQL statements that take the longest time to execute.

   The TopSQL feature sorts different types of SQL statements based on their execution time. The TopSQL query result reflects the performance of an OceanBase cluster, OceanBase Database tenant, or OBServer to execute different types of SQL statements in a period. You can locate poor-performing SQL statements in the database by using this feature.

* SlowSQL statements: SQL statements whose execution time exceeds the slow-query threshold. You can use the SlowSQL diagnosis feature to identify risky statements and avoid risks.

   The SlowSQL query result usually reflects the performance changes of an SQL statement in different periods. You can use the SlowSQL feature to locate the causes of the SQL performance changes.

* ParallelSQL statements: SQL statements that are configured with a degree of parallelism in a single execution.

   You can use ParallelSQL diagnostics to identify SQL statements that do not meet query performance expectations in analytical processing.

## Suspicious SQL diagnostics

Procedure:

1. In the left-side navigation pane, click **Tenants** and click the target tenant in the **Tenants** list to go to the **Overview** page of the tenant.

2. In the left-side navigation pane, click **SQL Diagnostics** to go to the **SQL Diagnostics** page.

   The SQL diagnostic data is not displayed on the **SQL Diagnostics** page if you do not set the values of both the cluster parameter `enable_sql_audit` and the tenant parameter `ob_enable_sql_audit` to True. You can click **Change Cluster Parameters** in the prompt to modify the parameter values.

3. Click the **Suspected SQL** tab.

4. Filter the suspicious SQL statements.

   1. Specify the filter conditions

      * **Time Range**: You can select **Last 5 Minutes**, **Last 10 Minutes**, **Last 20 Minutes**, **Last 30 Minutes**, **Last 1 Hour**, or **Last 3 Hours** from the **Time Range** drop-down list. You can also select **Custom Time** from the drop-down list and specify the start time and end time as needed. By default, the information for the last 30 minutes is displayed.

      * **Internal SQL**: If you select this option, the SQL statements internally initiated in OceanBase Database are displayed in the query result.

      * **Keyword**: The SQL statements that contain the specified keyword are displayed in the query result. The keywords filter SQL statements in the same way as the SQL Like operator. The entered strings are automatically prefixed and suffixed with a percent sign (%).

      * **Advanced Search**: You can add multiple filter conditions in **Advanced Search**. Click **Add**. In the **Add Advanced Condition** dialog box, you can specify a metric, an operator, and a metric value. The SQL statements that match the specified criteria will be displayed in the query result.

   2. Click **Search** to list all SQL statements that meet the search criteria.

5. Click **Export Suspicious SQL Statements** to export all suspicious SQL statements in the query result.

6. View the information about suspicious SQL statements.

   You can click the SQL text of an SQL statement to go to the **SQL Details** page of the statement. On the **SQL Details** page, you can view the following details of the SQL statement:

   * In the **SQL Text** section, you can view the complete SQL statement.
   * In the **Optimization Suggestions** section, you can view the optimization suggestions for the SQL statement.
   * You can view the diagnostic results within a specific period of time. The following table describes some diagnoses and their suggested solutions.

|     Diagnostic type      |                                 Related parameter                                  | Index analysis required | SQL risk level |                                                         Description and suggestion                                                                                                                                                                                |

CPU utilization = CPU time for executing the SQL statement/CPU time for executing all SQL statements of the tenant * 100%. Check your business scenarios, data distribution changes, request increases, and execution plan changes.  |

You can search for parameters on the **System Parameters** page of OCP and modify their default values to define the objects to be diagnosed and the diagnostic criteria.

   * On the **Historical Trends** tab, you can view the historical trends of the SQL statement.
   * On the **Execution Plans** tab, you can view the execution plans of the SQL statement.
   * On the **Index** tab, you can view the indexes bound to the SQL statement.

      OCP allows you to bind an index to an outline. You can bind an index to an SQL ID, so that OceanBase Database selects this index when it executes the SQL statement. At present, you can bind only one index to an SQL ID. For more information, see **Plan binding**.

      <main id="notice" type='explain'>
      <h4>Note</h4>
      <p>The outline feature relies on the hint and plan cache features of OceanBase Database. The hint feature determines the selection of the physical plan generation path by specifying the index and the connection method. The plan cache caches physical plans for SQL statements. When the same SQL statement is executed again in the same environment, the system reads its execution plan from the plan cache. It does not have to go through the parser, resolver, rewriter, and optimizer modules again. This speeds up the execution of SQL statements.  The outline feature uses hints to specify how to fix plans by modifying the physical execution plan in the plan cache. </p>
      </main>

   * On the **SQL Throttling** tab, you can view or set the throttling of the SQL statement.
   * To view the binding records of the SQL statement, click the button in section ① as illustrated on the **Execution Plans**, **Index**, and **SQL Throttling** tabs.

      ![SQL binding records](https://help-static-aliyun-doc.aliyuncs.com/assets/img/zh-CN/7490489461/p429706.png)

      In the binding records, you can view the status of a bound execution plan, or click **Unbind** to unbind the plan from the SQL statement. You can also click **Bind** to bind the plan to the SQL statement again.

7. Set throttling.

   * Click **Enable Throttling** to throttle the SQL statement.

   * Select multiple SQL statements and click **Batch Set Throttling**. In the dialog box that appears, specify the maximum number of concurrent threads for executing the SQL statements.

## SlowSQL diagnostics

Before SlowSQL diagnosis, you can set a regular execution time for SQL statements. By default, when the execution time of an SQL statement reaches 100 ms, the SQL statement is considered a slow SQL statement. You can perform the following steps to change the default slow SQL threshold:

1. Execute the following SQL statements in a command-line tool or OceanBase Developer Center (ODC) to change the default slow SQL threshold to 120000 μs.

   ```sql
   select collect_elapsed_threshold_us from ob_agent_collection_config_history
   where collection_name = 'slow_sql';

   update ob_agent_collection_config_history set collect_elapsed_threshold_us = 12000000 where collection_name = 'slow_sql';
   ```

2. Change the value of the OCP system parameter `ocp.ob.slowsql.threshold` to 120000 μs.
