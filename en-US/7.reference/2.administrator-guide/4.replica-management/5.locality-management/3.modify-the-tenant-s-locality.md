# Modify tenant locality

This topic describes how to modify the locality of a tenant.

To modify the locality of a tenant, the following rules must be met:

* You must specify the locality of the tenant.

* When a tenant locality change is not finished, the next tenant locality change cannot be performed.

Before you change the locality of a tenant, verify the state of the resource units and the resource pool in the target zone. If OBServer nodes in the target zone do not have enough resources to store the new resource units of the tenant, the locality cannot be changed.

For more information about how to check the status of resource units and the resource pool of a zone, see [View resources of a cluster](../../2.basic-database-management/1.manage-clusters/10.view-the-resource-information-of-a-cluster.md).

To modify the locality of a tenant, use the following syntax:

```sql
ALTER TENANT 'TENANT_NAME' SET LOCALITY = 'locality_description'
```

To change the locality of the test_tenant tenant to `F{1}@z1,F{1}@z2,F{1}@z3,F{1}@z4`, execute the following statement:

```sql
obclient> ALTER TENANT test_tenant SET LOCALITY = 'F{1}@z1,F{1}@z2,F{1}@z3,F{1}@z4';
```
