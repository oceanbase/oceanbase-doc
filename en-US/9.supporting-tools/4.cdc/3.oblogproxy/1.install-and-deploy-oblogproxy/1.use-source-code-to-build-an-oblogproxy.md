Use source code to build an oblogproxy 
===========================================================

You can install and deploy an oblogproxy by using the source code or downloading the installation package. This topic describes how to build an ologproxy by using the source code. 

Compilation 
--------------------------------

### Prerequisites 

1. You have installed CMake.

   You must install CMake 3.20 or later. You can go to the [download page](https://cmake.org/download/) to download and install the CMake.
   

2. You have installed the required dependencies.

   Install dependencies based on the operating system:
   * Fedora-based operating systems, including CentOS, Fedora, OpenAnolis, RedHat, and UOS

     ```bash
     yum install git wget rpm rpm-build cpio gcc gcc-c++ make glibc-devel glibc-headers libstdc++-static binutils
     ```

     
   

   
   <!-- -->

   * Debian-based operating systems, including Debian and Ubuntu

     ```bash
     apt-get install git wget rpm rpm2cpio cpio gcc make build-essential binutils
     ```

     
   

   




### Compilation steps 

#### Use CMake for compilation 

```bash
mkdir buildenv && cd buildenv
# Generate
cmake .. 
# Run
make -j 6
```


**Note**



After you perform the preceding steps, `logproxy` binary files are generated in the current directory.

### Compilation options 

When you run CMake compilation, you can add compilation options to change the default compilation behavior. For example, by default, when the demo is generated after compilation, the `demo_client` binaries will also be generated in the current directory. 

```bash
mkdir buildenv && cd buildenv
cmake -DWITH_DEMO=ON .. 
make -j 6
```



#### Customize liboblog.so 

1. Get liboblog.so

   You can specify the liboblog to be compiled. You can choose a precompiled package or choose to compile it on your own. 
   * Download the precompiled package

     You can download the precompiled liboblog package from the [Release page](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase/releases). The liboblog package is named in the oceanbase-ce-devel-xxxx format.OS version.x86_64.rpm. You may choose the package based on your OS version and decompress it:

     ```bash
     rpm2cpio oceanbase-ce-devel-xxxx.OS version.x86_64.rpm | cpio -div && mv ./usr ./liboblog
     ```

     

     After decompression,
     * liboblog.so is in the `./liboblog/lib` directory.

       
     
     * liboblog.h is in the `./liboblog/include` directory.

       
     

     
   
   * Compile liboblog

     To compile the [liboblog](https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase#how-to-build), you need to add the `OB_BUILD_LIBOBLOG=ON` parameter when compiling the OceanBase code repository. For more information, see [liboblog compilation instructions](../../2.liboblog/1.deploy-and-use-liboblog/1.install-and-deploy-liboblog.md).

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/oceanbase/oceanbase.git && cd oceanbase
     bash ./build.sh release --init -DOB_BUILD_LIBOBLOG=ON --make
     ```

     

     Get the compilation products:
     * liboblog.so: in the `build_release/src/liboblog/src/` directory.

       
     
     * liboblog.h: in the `src/liboblog/src/` directory.

       
     

     
   

   

2. Compile oblogproxy

   If you choose to customize liboblog.so, turn on the custom liboblog switch and specify the path in the compilation command when you compile oblogproxy:

   ```bash
   mkdir buildenv && cd buildenv
   # Set the CMake environment variables so that CMake can find the precompiled liboblog
   CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/path/to/liboblog CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/liboblog cmake -DUSE_LIBOBLOG=ON .. 
   # Run
   make -j 6
   ```

   
   **Note**

   

   Assume that you have put the `liboblog.so` and `liboblog.h` files in the `/path/to/liboblog` directory.

### Notes on dependency compilation 

By default, CMake automatically downloads and compiles dependency libraries. However, pay attention to the following components:

* OpenSSL: The currently used version is 1.0.1e. 

  **Notice**

  

  In OpenSSL 1.0.\* or 1.1.\* , some APIs are incompatible. At present, liboblog and logproxy are both implemented based 1.0.\* Therefore, you must ensure that the versions are consistent.
  

* liboblog: As described earlier, you can download a precompiled liboblog or compile it on your own, and then set the environment variables to specify the path of liboblog. LD_LIBRARY_PATH must be specified for running liboblog.

  

* libaio: A liboblog dependency.

  




Run the oblogproxy 
---------------------------------------

The oblogproxy configuration file `conf.json` can be found in the code directory. 

1. Configure the sys tenant

   After you obtain the username and password of the sys tenant of your OBServer, you need to encrypt them and configure them for oblogproxy. Run the following command to obtain the encrypted strings of the username and password:

   ```bash
   # Assume that the username and password are user and pswd respectively.
   ./logproxy -x user
   # After you run the command, you will get the following string: 4B9C75F64934174F4E77EE0E9A58****.
   ./logproxy -x pswd
   # After you run the command, you will get the following string: DCE2AF09D006D6A440816880B938****
   ```

   

   Configure the encrypted username and password strings to the `ob_sys_username` and `ob_sys_password` fields of the ` conf.json` file. For example:

   ```json
   {
     "ob_sys_username": "4B9C75F64934174F4E77EE0E9A58****",
     "ob_sys_password": "DCE2AF09D006D6A440816880B938****"
   }
   ```

   

2. Organize the program directory

   ```bash
   # Create a program directory
   mkdir -p ./oblogproxy/bin ./oblogproxy/run 
   # Copy the configuration file
   cp -r ../conf ./oblogproxy/
   # Copy the start and stop script
   cp ../script/run.sh ./oblogproxy/
   # Copy the program binaries
   cp logproxy ./oblogproxy/bin/
   ```

   

3. Start the oblogproxy

   ```bash
   cd ./oblogproxy
   # Specify the liboblog.so directory for dynamic dependence of oblogproxy
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/liboblog
   bash ./run.sh start
   ```

   

   By default, the `2983` port is listened on. You can set the `service_port` field in the `conf.json` file to change the port. 
   **Note**

   

   You can then subscribe to [OceanBase Log Client](https://github.com/oceanbase/oblogclient) for OceanBase data. For more information, see [Documentation](https://github.com/oceanbase/oblogclient).
   




Link encryption 
------------------------------------

### TLS communication between OceanBase Log Client and oblogproxy 

In the `conf.json` file, make the following changes:

* `channel_type`: "tls". Enable TLS for the communication with OceanBase Log Client.

  

* `tls_ca_cert_file`: the path of the CA certificate file.

  

* `tls_cert_file`: the path of the server-side signature certificate.

  

* `tls_key_file`: the path of the server-side private key.

  

* `tls_verify_peer`: "true". Enable verification for OceanBase Log Client.

  



**Notice**



* Configure OceanBase Log Client accordingly. For more information, see [OceanBase Log Client link encryption](https://github.com/oceanbase/oblogclient).

  

* All the preceding paths must be absolute paths.

  




### TLS communication between oblogproxy (liboblog) and OBServer 

**Note**



oblogproxy runs liboblog to interact with an OBServer.

In the `conf.json` file, make the following changes:

* `liboblog_tls`: "true". Enable TLS communication with OBServer.

  

* `liboblog_tls_cert_path`: the absolute path of the related OBServer certificate files. You may copy the `wallet` folder in the OBServer deployment file directory. Ensure that the directory includes the following files: ca.pem, client-cert.pem, and client-key.pem.
